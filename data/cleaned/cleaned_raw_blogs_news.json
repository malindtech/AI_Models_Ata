    "text": "The New York City Ballet Board of Directors announced on Saturday the interim team that has been appointed to run the artistic side of the company during ballet master in chief Peter Martins' leave of absence. Martins requested a temporary leave from both NYCB and the School of American Ballet last Thursday while the company undergoes an internal investigation into the sexual harassment accusations aimed at him.\n\nThe four-person group is made up of members of the company's current artistic staff, led by ballet master and former principal dancer Jonathan Stafford. Joining Stafford are NYCB resident choreographer and soloist Justin Peck and ballet masters Craig Hall and Rebecca Krohn, both former dancers with the company. While the members of this group haven't had much leadership experience, their close familiarity with the company (Krohn left the stage for her new role just two months ago) should help to ease the dancers' transition.\n\nThe team will be responsible for the day-to-day artistic needs of the company including scheduling, casting and conducting rehearsals. While there's no word yet on the length of their tenure, we'll continue to keep you updated as the story surrounding Martins unfolds.",

To celebrate game day (and cheer on their region's respective teams), the dancers of Pennsylvania Ballet and Boston Ballet took a break from their usual rehearsals to perform some Super Bowl-themed choreography.\n\nDressed in their Eagles green, the PAB dancers performed a fast-paced routine full of fouett\u00e9 turns, sky-high jumps and some swan arms (because they're known as the birds, get it?).\n\nBut Boston Ballet also decided to get in on the fun-with five Super Bowl wins, they're used to seeing their team in the big game. Sharing their own video on Facebook, which stars principal Paul Craig and soloist Derek Dunn, Boston Ballet threw in a few Balanchine tricks thanks to some props from Prodigal Son.\n\nThis is officially our new favorite way to get in on the football fun.",

    "title": "Rebecca Krohn on Her Retirement from New York City Ballet",
    "text": "New York City Ballet principal dancer Rebecca Krohn will take her final bow with the company this Saturday night. Krohn joined NYCB as an apprentice in the fall of 1998 and slowly rose through the ranks, becoming a principal in 2012. Though Krohn is best known for her flawless execution of classic Balanchine leotard ballets, her repertoire is vast, spanning Jerome Robbins to Justin Peck. After dancing Stravinsky Violin Concerto with Amar Ramasar on Saturday, Krohn will return to the NYCB studios on Monday in a new role: ballet master. We had the chance to talk to the thoughtful and eloquent dancer about her time with the company and goals for the future.\n\nWas New York City Ballet always your dream company?\n\nAs soon as I knew I wanted to be a professional dancer, I knew that I wanted to be in New York City Ballet. I moved to New York when I was 14 to train at the School of American Ballet, and I got my apprenticeship with the company when I was 17, so it was really a dream come true.\n\nKrohn and Adrian Danchig-Waring in Balanchine's Stravinsky Violin Concerto. Video Courtesy NYCB.\n\nWhat have been your favorite ballets or roles to dance?\n\nBalanchine's Stravinsky Violin Concerto, which I'll dance for my final show, has always been a favorite, as well as Balanchine's Movements for Piano and Orchestra and Agon. Also Robbins' Dances at a Gathering... there are so many, it's hard to choose! I've always really loved the Balanchine black and white ballets, and there are some Robbins ballets that are always so fulfilling.\n\nCan you think of a favorite moment with the company?\n\nAfter almost 20 years there are countless things. In general I would say the time that I've had onstage with some of my friends and dancing partners has been so special. It's one thing to be a friend with someone and another to also share the stage with them. There's just an amazing sense of trust and spontaneity; I feel so connected when I'm out there. That's something I'll never forget.\n\nWhat's the main way that your experience in the company has changed over the years?\n\nAs I was getting older the company all of a sudden started to seem younger and younger. When I became a soloist and especially a principal my relationship with the corps de ballet dancers shifted. I wanted to be someone that the young dancers could look up to; I wanted to reach out and connect to them more, and to offer support and advice.\n\nKrohn and Amara Ramasar in Balanchine's \"Movements for Piano and Orchestra.\" Photo by Paul Kolnik, Courtesy NYCB.\n\nDid you always know that you wanted to stay on with the company?\n\nIt had been in the back of my mind for a number of years, but I didn't really address it formally until a year ago. I spoke to Peter (Martins), just to kind of let him know what I had been thinking. I wanted to hear how he felt about it, which was actually a little nerve-wracking, but he thought it was a great idea.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to in your new role?\n\nI'd like to nurture them and their talents; I'm always amazed to see how talented everyone is. The ballets that we have in our repertoire are so amazing-it's a great honor to be able to carry them on with the new dancers for the future.\n\nKrohn with Robert Fairchild in Justin Peck's Everywhere We Go. Video Courtesy NYCB.\n\nIs there someone who's teaching style or mentorship style you'd most like to emulate?\n\nThere are a couple of ballet masters that I've connected to. I'm very close to Karin von Aroldingen. Her undying passion for these pieces is incredibly inspiring. Susan Hendl has also been an inspiration. She has a wonderful talent of drawing out everyone's unique qualities and femininity.\n\nWhat parts of your life outside of ballet do you most look forward to cultivating now that you'll have more time on your hands?\n\nI'm looking forward to having more time to enjoy museums in the city. While I was dancing I didn't want to be up on my legs all day on my days off. I won't have to worry about that so much now, and I can spend my day off roaming around and being inspired. I also love to cook, so I'll get to cook a lot more and hopefully host more dinner parties.\n\nKrohn and Company in Balanchine's \"Serenade.\" Photo by Paul Kolnik, Courtesy NYCB.\n\nDo you have a piece of advice for young dancers who are just starting out?\n\nWhat's so special about ballet is the discipline that it instills. It's important for young dancers to really understand that that is what's taught to you in ballet class every day. It's an invaluable quality for a person to have, whether they continue to dance or end up doing other things.\n\nMy other piece of advice is that you have to treat each day as a new start. Some days you might not feel good about yourself, or things in your body might not be working well-every day is different. But you have to start fresh, be positive and move forward.",

    "text": "In 2014 the dance world was surprised when longtime Pennsylvania Ballet artistic director Roy Kaiser stepped down. It was announced yesterday that Kaiser will be rising to the helm again as the Las Vegas-based Nevada Ballet Theatre's new artistic director, replacing James Canfield. Kaiser will be the fourth artistic director in NBT's 46 year history.\n\nThe company will be gaining a highly experienced leader. Following his rise through the ranks to principal dancer at Pennsylvania Ballet, Kaiser worked as a ballet master and eventually took the reigns as the company's artistic director in 1995. Pennsylvania Ballet added 90 new ballets and 35 world premieres to their repertoire under his leadership.\n\nRoy Kaiser with Pennsylvania Ballet Dancers.

    "text": "New York City Ballet continues its first year without Peter Martins at the helm as our spring season opens tonight.\n\nWhen he retired at the start of the new year, we plunged headfirst into unknown, murky waters. Who would the new director be? When would we know? Would we dancers get some say in the decision? Who would oversee the Balanchine ballets? Who would be in charge of casting? Would a new director bring along huge upheaval? Could some of us be out of a job?\n\nThe dancers currently have little information about the search process and plans to move forward. But Mr. Martins' absence has certainly been felt around the theater.\n\nI've noticed it the most during dress rehearsals, particularly for Balanchine ballets. Although he rarely attended daily rehearsals, he always supervised the final rehearsals before the ballets went before the audience. Frequently, he had a nugget of wisdom to share, often from the mouth of Balanchine himself, to help us fix a tricky partnering maneuver, or a difficult sequence of turns.",

    "title": "Nutcracker Secrets and Surprises",
    "text": "E.T.A. Hoffmann, a German writer, penned the eerie and dark tale \"Nutcracker and Mouse King\" in 1816. About 30 years later, the French writer Alexandre Dumas took the Nutcracker story into his own hands, lightening things up and softening the character descriptions. Dumas even cheered up the name of the protagonist. \"Marie Stahlbaum\" (meaning \"steel tree,\" representing the repressive family Marie found herself in, which led her imagination to run wild) became \"Clara Silberhaus\" (translated to \"silver house,\" a magnificent home filled with shiny magic.)\n\nSnowflakes of the original cast, \"The Nutcracker\" at the Mariinsky Theatre, 1892. Photo by Walter E. Owen, Courtesy Dance Magazine Archives.\n\nIn 1892 St. Petersburg, choreographer Marius Petipa and composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky pulled the story off the page and onto the stage of the Mariinsky Theatre. But Petipa fell ill while choreographing The Nutcracker and handed his duties over to his assistant, Lev Ivanov. Critics at the 1892 premiere were not pleased. Balletomanes felt the work to be uneven, and lamented the lack of a main ballerina in the first act. Many thought that the story was too light compared to historically based stories.\n\nDespite its initial reception, the ballet survived, partially due to the success of Tchaikovsky's score. Performances were scarce, though, as the Russian Revolution scattered its original dancers. The Nutcracker's first major exposure outside of Russia took place in London in 1934. Former Mariinsky ballet master Nikolas Sergeyev was tasked with staging Petipa's story ballets on the Vic-Wells Ballet (today The Royal Ballet) from the original notation. The notes were incomplete and difficult to read, yet Sergeyev persisted, and The Nutcracker made it to the stage.\n\nDancers from ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in \"The Nutcracker\" pas de deux.

Over the next decade, the company toured the ballet extensively, exposing it to audiences nationwide.\n\nWillam Christensen (center) with his brothers Lew and Harold.

Christensen later founded Ballet West, which continues to perform his version of The Nutcracker each year.\n\nBalanchine rehearsing the snow scene with NYCB. Photo by Frederick Melton, Courtesy Dance Magazine Archives.\n\nThough the ballet's popularity was already growing, some historians suggest that George Balanchine was the first to irretrievably link the work to the holidays. As dance critic Robert Greskovic puts it, Balanchine was \"responsible for making the ballet a fixture of the Christmas season and of a ballet company's repertory.\" New York City Ballet first presented Balanchine's Nutcracker in February of 1954 but quickly recognized its holiday appeal and moved the ballet to December for the following year.\n\nAs regional ballet companies sprouted around the country, The Nutcracker became a staple.Today it's a holiday tradition that keeps families coming back year after year; its mass appeal keeps ballet in mainstream culture. Many companies attract audiences by infusing the classic with their own regional heritage: Christopher Wheeldon's Nutcracker for the Joffrey Ballet is set at Chicago's 1893 world's fair and The Washington Ballet serves a dose of American history with characters such as George Washington and King George III.\n\nGeorge Washington in The Washington Ballet's Nutcracker.\" Photo by Carol Pratt, Courtesy The Washington Ballet.\n\nThe Nutcracker also serves as the financial backbone of companies nationwide. Last year San Francisco Ballet sold a total of 87,926 tickets to the holiday ballet and Boston Ballet sold a total of 92,907. Despite its humble roots, The Nutcracker is now the show that companies rely on to put on inventive and cutting-edge works throughout the rest of the year.\n\nAccording to dance historian Doug Fullington, in the original 1892 scenario the Nutcracker has two sisters who graciously welcome Clara to the Land of Sweets with warm hugs.\n\nPennsylvania Ballet's Craig Wasserman in the Candy Cane variation. Photo by Alexander Iziliaev, Courtesy Pennsylvania Ballet.\n\nThe Candy Cane variation (danced to the Russian Trepak music) was choreographed by its original 1892 dancer, Alexandre Shiryaev. Dance critic Mindy Aloff says that Shiryaev was \"possibly the first practitioner of hand-drawn animation; he notated his choreography in sequential drawings that could be projected to show the dance in movement.\" Balanchine included Shiryaev's original choreography in his Nutcracker.\n\nThe ethereal twinkling sound in the Sugar Plum Fairy's solo comes from the celesta, a rare instrument Tchaikovsky heard in France. \"He had one sent to him essentially in secret,\" says Fullington.\n\nBalanchine was given a budget of $40,000 for his 1954 premiere and, according to Aloff, he spent $25,000 on the Christmas tree alone. When asked if he could do without the tree Balanchine responded, \"[The ballet] is the tree.\" Today, New York City Ballet's tree weighs one ton and can reach a full height of 41 feet.\n\n1892 \"Nutcracker\" costume sketch by Ivan Vsevolozhsky of the Sugar Plum Fairy's retinue. Courtesy Peter Koppers.\n\nChoreographic notations suggest that the Cavalier's variation was originally danced by a retinue of eight female fairies representing things like fruit, flowers and dreams. According to Fullington, Pavel Gerdt, the dancer who created the role, was likely too old to dance the variation himself.\n\nNYCB's Brittany Pollack and Chase Finlay in the grand pas de deux toe slide.

    "title": "Inside the Beijing Dance Academy",
    "text": "In one of 60 spacious dance studios at the Beijing Dance Academy, Pei Yu Meng practices a tricky step from Jorma Elo's Over Glow. She's standing among other students, but they all work alone, with the help of teachers calling out corrections from the front of the room. On top of her strong classical foundation and clean balletic lines, Pei Yu's slithery coordination and laser-sharp focus give her dancing a polished gleam. Once she's mastered the pirouette she's been struggling with, she repeats the step over and over until the clock reaches 12 pm for lunch. Here, every moment is a chance to approach perfection.\n\nPei Yu came to the school at age 10 from Hebei, a province near Beijing. Now 20, and in her third year of BDA's professional program, she is an example of a new kind of Chinese ballet student. Founded in 1954 by the country's communist government, BDA is a fully state-funded professional training school with close to 3,000 students and 275 full-time teachers over four departments (ballet, classical Chinese dance, social dance and musical theater). It offers degrees in performance, choreography and more. BDA's ballet program has long been known for fostering pristine Russian-style talent. But since 2011, the school has made major efforts to broaden ballet students' knowledge of Chinese dance traditions and the works of Western contemporary ballet choreographers. Pointe went inside this prestigious academy to see how BDA trains its dancers.\n\nBDA's admission process is extremely competitive, despite the school's large numbers. The ballet program is made up of a lower division, lasting seven years, and a four-year professional bachelor program.\n\nThe professional division's admission procedure is extensive. Every year, hundreds of students ages 16 to 18 audition in Beijing over the course of two days, presenting classical and contemporary variations and improvisational work, and taking an academic exam. \"We are looking to produce artists with the technical skills to excel in professional companies and the knowledge to work in all jobs in the field of dance,\" says the ballet department's executive and artistic director and former National Ballet of China principal Zhirui (Regina) Zou.\n\nNearly 100 are currently enrolled in the professional ballet program. Though the school does admit foreign applicants, it does not host international students very often because the academic entrance exam measures Chinese language proficiency (most classes are taught in Chinese). BDA does participate in exchange programs with ballet schools around the world.\n\nStudents begin their days with an early 8 am technique class. Following the Vaganova method, classes are strict and focus on precise positions and placement. Upper levels are split to keep class size small-around eight students per class. Teachers correct individual students-usually only the best ones, positioned front and center-using the terms \"not good\" (b\u00f9 ha\u02c7o) and \"better\" (g\u00e8ng ha\u02c7o), but rarely awarding praise.\n\nThe day continues with classical Chinese dance, character, contemporary, repertoire and pas de deux, as well as dance history, anatomy, music appreciation and injury prevention. \"Classical Chinese dance is a large part of our identity as Chinese ballet dancers,\" explains Zou. She points out an example from a girls' ballet class, where students circle their heads as if in a reverse renvers\u00e9 during an attitude promenade. \"Chinese dance focuses on circular upper-body movements, a unique coordination that complements ballet technique.\"\n\nRehearsals and classes can end as late as 9 pm. Students live on campus in dormitories; with little free time and all focus placed on their futures, they consider BDA home until graduation.\n\nBDA's ballet department in a performance of \"La Bayad\u00e8re.\" Photo Courtesy BDA.\n\nPerformance is the most important aspect of BDA students' professional development, with annual productions featuring classical ballets, contemporary works and student choreography. Since dancers don't usually audition internationally, these performances are their chance to be discovered-directors from surrounding Chinese companies, including the National Ballet of China, attend in order to scout new talent.\n\nAs a result, preparation is intense. In a studio rehearsal for La Bayad\u00e8re, Act II, no understudies are present, and any imperfection is pointed out by one of four coaches at the front of the room. All lines, heads, arms and feet are perfectly placed. Although Pei Yu sparkles in her variation, the other dancers are similarly strong and dedicated. Students run the piece twice for stamina. Between run-throughs, each fastidiously practices difficult sections, never satisfied with the results.\n\nDancers approach more contemporary movement with a mature coordination mirroring many professional dancers. Recent performances have included works by Paul Taylor, Jorma Elo and Christopher Wheeldon; students often get to work with the choreographers directly. Pei Yu learned Over Glow from Elo himself. \"He showed us how to handle rhythm with the whole body,\" she says. \"Ballet has so many rules, but contemporary ballet makes me feel excited and free.\"\n\nSun Jie, a coach and men's teacher at BDA since 2008, explains how introducing works from Western choreographers has broadened the overall abilities of Chinese ballet dancers. \"When we started to teach new works at BDA in 2011, students struggled to move freely or adapt to new movement,\" he says. \"But learning these styles over time has opened dancers' eyes to new possibilities.\"\n\nBDA students enter professional life somewhat older than in the West, with graduates ranging from 20 to 22 years old. Only the most promising students receive company contracts, but others accept teaching and other dance-related posts at BDA and surrounding dance schools and institutions.\n\nAlthough many have won awards at international competitions, the school does not actively focus on competing. \"To prepare competitors, so much attention must be placed on individual students, whereas performances encourage the entire student body,\" says Zou.\n\nEven so, competitions have given these students international exposure, though only a small percentage of graduates accept jobs abroad. BDA alumni in American companies include San Francisco Ballet soloists Wei Wang and Wanting Zhao and ABT corps members Zhiyao Zhang and Xuelan Lu.\n\nWith graduation in sight, Pei Yu shares the same dream as many of her classmates: a spot with the National Ballet of China. P\n\nA men's classical Chinese dance class. Photo by Lucy Van Cleef.\n\nExposure to the Danish Bournonville style is a special component of the diverse ballet education that BDA offers. Former Royal Danish Ballet artistic director Frank Andersen has been a guest teacher at the school since 2002, and was awarded a professorship in 2012. So far, BDA students have performed in Bournonville ballets including Napoli's Act III, La Ventana and Conservatory, and some danced in the National Ballet of China's 2015 production of La Sylphide. Thanks to almost 23 years of Andersen's work in Beijing, Bournonville has found a second home in China.\n\nThough there are Bournonville technique classes when time allows, Andersen imparts those lessons through the repertoire and Danish mime. \"The most important part is making the mime believable,\" Andersen explains. \"Young dancers often have the urge to overact. If I can't describe what I want with words, I have to show them.\" He holds his hands towards his chest, indicating the sign for \"I.\" \"Showing can be more effective than telling. That's the beauty of Bournonville's work. It's so honest.\"",

We've pulled together some highlights.\n\nThe Bolshoi Premiere of John Neumeier's Anna Karenina\n\nLast July Hamburg Ballet presented the world premiere of John Neumeier's Anna Karenina, a modern adaptation on Leo Tolstoy's famous novel. Hamburg Ballet coproduced the full-length ballet with the National Ballet of Canada and the Bolshoi, the latter of which will premiere the work March 23 (NBoC will have its premiere in November). The production will feature Bolshoi star Svetlana Zakharova in the title role. This is especially fitting as Neumeier's initial inspiration for the ballet came from Zakharova while they were working together on his Lady of the Camellias. The following video delves into what makes this production stand out.\n\nWorld Premieres at Richmond Ballet and Ballet Arizona\n\nRichmond Ballet's New Works Festival March 20-25 features pieces by four choreographers who have never worked with Richmond Ballet before: Francesca Harper, Tom Mattingly, Mariana Oliveira and Bradley Shelver. But there's a twist: each choreographer had only 25 hours with the dancers to create a 10-15 minute ballet.\n\nMeanwhile the Phoenix-based company's spring season opens with Today's Masters 2018, March 22-25. The program includes a company premiere by Alejandro Cerrudo and world premieres by Nayon Iovino and artistic director Ib Andersen. Andersen's Pelvis features dance moves and costumes from the 1950s and references to Elvis Presley (pElvis, anyone?)\n\nMysterious; romantic; witty; electrifying. That's how SFB describes their upcoming tribute to Jerome Robbins, March 20-25. The company is one of dozens of others honoring Robbins this year; last week we covered Cincinnati Ballet and New York Theatre Ballet. SFB is presenting four works celebrating the famed choreographer's career in ballet and Broadway: Fancy Free, Opus 19/The Dreamer, The Cage and Other Dances.\n\nReid and Harriet Designs at the Guggenheim\n\nMarch 25-27, costume design duo Reid Bartelme and Harriet Jung take the stage as part of Guggenheim Works & Process. The partnership is known for creatively intersecting design and dance; last summer they created a swimwear line based on Justin Peck costumes, and in November they presented their design-driven Nutcracker. For this week's show they collaborated with a long list of choreographers including Lar Lubovitch and Pam Tanowitz to create short works featuring their costumes. A number of dancers including New York City Ballet principal Russell Janzen will be acting as moving models.",

While those outside of the cinephile community might not be familiar with McLaren's work, he is commonly credited with advancing film techniques including animation and pixilation in the 20th century-he died in 1987. The Canadian artist's many accolades include a 1952 Oscar for Best Documentary for his abstract short film Neighbours (watch the whole thing here). Later in life, McLaren became interested in ballet, and made a number of dance films including his renowned 1968 Pas de deux.\n\nNBoC's new work, titled Frame by Frame, will run June 1-10 in Toronto. The ballet combines vignettes of McLaren's life with movement quotes from his films and real time recreations of his technological advances. It was created in collaboration by NBoC principal dancer and choreographic associate Guillaume C\u00f4t\u00e9 and film and stage director Robert Lepage, who is making his NBoC debut. Pointe touched base with C\u00f4t\u00e9 on how this interdisciplinary project came together.\n\nWhere did the initial spark for this idea come from?\n\nRobert and I have been wanting to work together for years. I approached him about doing a different project a long time ago, and he said \"well, maybe that's not the correct project.\" He came to me about four years after that and said \"I think I finally have something I'd like to work on with you,\" so then I approached the National Ballet.\n\nWere you familiar with McLaren's work before this project?\n\nI wasn't. Robert had just worked on a big McLaren documentary, and he got me to come see it and I realized that it was all about movement, and that this animator was basically a choreographer himself, a choreographer of space and time. There was all this material to work with and he'd made a number of iconic dance films, so it seemed like a no brainer. So I started my research and kept finding out more surprising fun facts about McLaren's passion for dance, like that he met Guy Glover, the man that he was in a relationship with for 50 years or so, in the audience at Covent Garden while watching a ballet. Guy was a curator of a dance festival in Canada.\n\nRobert Lepage and Guillaume C\u00f4t\u00e9 in rehearsal for \"Frame By Frame.\" Photo by Elias Djemil-Matassov, Courtesy NBoC.\n\nRobert had just finished his documentary and has a really deep understanding of this kind of Canadian culture. He'd already gotten incredible footage from the National Film Board of Canada of McLaren behind-the-scenes. I watched a tremendous amount of film, and I read a lot about him and his collaborators, and even met a few who are still alive. The research was truly enriching, because I realized how wonderful of a person he was as well, which dictates how we share his personal life onstage.\n\nWe had our first workshop four years ago. Since then we've been doing five-day workshops once a year in Robert's studio, Ex Machina, where he has a multi media team. They would put together projections and props for us to experiment with. Robert would give me some homework, and I'd take it on myself to create some impressionist sections. Sometimes we decided that they were great, and sometimes we decided that they weren't. It was this really collaborative way of getting things started because I was able to present dance first, and then we were able to add technology to it, as opposed to the technology taking over and stealing from the dance.\n\nArtists of the Ballet in rehearsal for \"Frame by Frame.\" Photo by David Leclerc, Courtesy NBoC.\n\nHow does the piece balance a narrative retelling of McLaren's life with reproductions of his works?\n\nI would say that the vignettes of his life are one third, and then the technologies that he pioneered and making abstract dance interpretations based on those technologies like stop motion or body painting and body projection are the second third. And then the last third is basically just direct quotes from his films and bringing them back to life. Like with Pas de deux, the effects in that film took him months to make, but now thanks to technology we can duplicate it live. It's not a story ballet per say, but there is a story from beginning to end.\n\nWhat was the process like of taking movement quotes from McLaren's films?",

    "text": "The Broadway revival of Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein's Carousel opened last week, and while it stars luminaries from the worlds of musical theater (Joshua Henry, Jessie Mueller) and opera (soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming), it also stars choreography by one of ballet's own heavy hitters: New York City Ballet soloist and resident choreographer Justin Peck, who shares top billing with the musical's director, Jack O'Brien.\n\nThere are more than a few familiar faces onstage, too. NYCB principal Amar Ramasar is cast as ne'er-do-well sailor Jigger Craigin, while NYCB soloist Brittany Pollack plays Louise, who dances Act II's famous \"dream ballet.\" American Ballet Theatre soloist Craig Salstein took a leave of absence from the company to serve as the show's dance captain and to perform in the ensemble, where he's joined by recent Miami City Ballet transplants Adriana Pierce and Andrei Chagas (a Pointe 2015 Star of the Corps). Several other veteran Broadway ballet dancers round out the cast, including An American in Paris alumni Leigh-Ann Esty (Miami City Ballet), David Prottas (NYCB) and Laura Feig (Atlanta Ballet, BalletX), and Come Fly Away's Amy Ruggiero (American Repertory Ballet, Ballet Austin, Twyla Tharp).\n\n\"CBS Sunday Morning\" recently ran a lengthy profile on Peck, who at age 30 has already established himself as one of the world's most in-demand choreographers. In addition to shedding light on his efforts to make ballet more accessible to modern audiences (\"I don't want ballet to feel like an elitist art form\"), Peck answers the question on everyone's mind in the post Peter Martins era: whether he's interested in becoming NYCB's next director. The profile also includes fun behind-the-scenes Carousel footage-check it out above.",

The Swedish choreographer is best known for his absurdist and cutting-edge productions. \"This is not Shakespeare's Midsummer,\" says Joffrey Ballet artistic director Ashley Wheater. The title of Ekman's version, which premiered with the Royal Swedish Ballet in 2015, refers not to Shakespeare but to Midsummer, the traditional Scandinavian summer solstice festival. The piece follows a young man through a day of revelry followed by a nightmare, blurring the line with reality. \"It's a kind of otherworldly dream,\" says Wheater.\n\nBringing Ekman's production to life is no small feat; the piece utilizes the entire Joffrey company. \"I can't think of another performance that has so many props,\" says Wheater, listing giant bales of hay, long banquet tables, umbrellas, beach chairs and more. The piece features a commissioned score by Swedish composer Mikael Karlsson, which will be performed onstage by singer Anna von Hausswolff. \"She is very much a part of the performance; she's kind of the narrator,\" says Wheater. Dancers also contribute to the narration with spoken text, including imagery of young love and a dose of humor.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Ballet in Alexander Ekman's \"Midsummer Night's Dream.\" Photo by Hans Nilsson, Courtesy Joffrey Ballet.\n\nThis will be the fourth work by Ekman that The Joffrey has performed. \"I think it says something that Alex trusts us to bring the work to its full realization,\" says Wheater. \"It's not just a few ballet steps here and there; he asks you to fully engage with yourself, not only as a dancer but as an actor and a person.\" Ekman's Midsummer will run April 25-May 6 at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago.",

    "text": "The Bay County Sheriff's Office has arrested four men from Atlanta after they allegedly hired local transients to cash fraudulent checks for them using stolen personal information. Three transients have also been arrested for their participation.\n\nBCSO Criminal Investigations opened an investigation after deputies initially responded to a call from a local transient who claimed he had been robbed by two men.\n\nInvestigators now believe that four black males came from Atlanta to the Destin area on October 1, 2017, and rented two vehicles. On October 3, 2017, they came to Bay County and two of them\u2500Johnathan Johnson and Germarco Johnson\u2500 picked up transient Scott Allen McNeight, age 44. McNeight was recently released from prison on October 1, 2017. They first asked McNeight if he had a photo ID, which he did. The men took a photo of the ID and sent it to the two other men from Atlanta. A fraudulent check was created using McNeight's information and stolen routing numbers and checking account numbers.\n\nThe other two suspects from Atlanta\u2500Clarence Suggs and Reginald Hughes\u2500 picked up transient James Dean Riles, age 58, for the same purpose. The two transients were first taken to a thrift store in Springfield. The Atlanta men purchased better clothing for the transients to wear when they entered banks to cash the fraudulent checks. Once dressed, McNeight was taken to a bank on Panama City Beach and was able to cash a 1,600 check. Although the agreement was for the transients to get about $80 for their part in the scam, McNeight took half of the money and fled on foot.\n\nDemarko Johnson and Johnathan Johnson were able to find McNeight at a gas station at Magnolia Beach Road and Thomas Drive. The two men entered the gas station after McNeight, one of them carrying a tire iron. Johnathon Johnson put McNeight in a choke hold, and they threatened McNeight with the tire iron, and took the money, his wallet, and his cell phone.\n\nThat was when McNeight called the BCSO to report the robbery. Although initially not forthcoming about the true circumstances surrounding the robbery, McNeight eventually told investigators how he got the money.\n\nJames Dean Riles, the other transient, was unable to cash his fraudulent check at the first bank, and was taken by Clarence Suggs and Reginald Hughes to a second bank where he was successful. He was paid $80 and was taken by the two men to Millville and left. Riles then called the Panama City Police Department to file a complaint about what he had done. Riles had important tag information on one of the vehicles.\n\nUsing the tag information, investigators were able to learn the two vehicles were rentals and eventually identified the four men from Atlanta. A BOLO was put out to local law enforcement on the vehicles.\n\nOne was located at a business on East Avenue and contact was made with Clarence Suggs, age 27, and Reginald Hughes, age 26. They were arrested. Suggs and Hughes were charged with Counterfeiting of an Instrument with Intent to Defraud (two counts), Principal/Accessory to Uttering a False Bank Bill (two counts), and Larceny $300 or more but less than $5000 (two counts).\n\nA BCSO investigator spotted the second vehicle in a grocery store parking lot in Lynn Haven. He watched as a man left a bank adjacent to the parking lot, and got into the vehicle with two black males. A traffic stop was done and Johnathan Johnson, age 22, and Germarco Johnson, age 27, cousins, were arrested. Johnathan Johnson was charged with Robbery with a Weapon, Counterfeiting of an Instrument with Intent to Defraud (two counts), Principal/Accessory to Uttering a False Bank Bill (two counts), Larceny $300 or more but less than $5000 (two counts), and Violation of Probation for Financial Identity Fraud. Germarco Johnson was charged with Robbery with a Firearm, Counterfeiting of an Instrument with Intent to Defraud (two counts), Principal/Accessory to Uttering a False Bank Bill (two counts), and Larceny $300 or more but less than $5000 (two counts).\n\nThe white male with them was identified as Charles Edward Sinard, age 39, a transient. He was also arrested and charged with Uttering a False Bank Bill, Larceny $300 or more but less than $5000, and Criminal Mischief, $1000 or more.\n\nThe other two transients involved in this case, Riles and McNeight, were also arrested and charged with Uttering a False Bank Bill and Larceny $300 or more but less than $5000.\n\nDuring a search warrant on the two vehicles two printers, blank checks, cash, and a computer with check-making software were located and seized.\n\nAll seven men were taken to the Bay County Jail and booked.",

    "text": "One of the most challenging tasks on an admin's list is the management of projects and tickets. This can be especially overwhelming when you have a larger IT department and a staff working on numerous projects at once. But the management of projects and ticket issues doesn't just fall on the heads of large companies. Even if you're a one-person shop consultancy, it can be easy to drown in a quagmire of projects.\n\nThankfully, there are a lot of tools available to help you with that. If you happen to be a fan of open source (and who isn't?), those tools are not only readily available, they are free and (generally speaking) easy to set up. I want to walk you through the installation of one such tool: Trac. Trac can be used as a wiki, a project management system, and for tracking bugs in software development. I'll be demonstrating the installation on a Ubuntu Server 16.04. And so, let's get to it.\n\nThe installation isn't terribly challenging, but does require a bit of typing. Log into your Ubuntu server and let's take care of the dependencies.\n\nIf your Ubuntu Server platform is without Apache, install it with the command:\n\nOnce that completes, install Trac with the command:\n\nsudo apt-get install trac libapache2-mod-wsgi -y\n\nNext, the auth_digest module must be enabled with the command:\n\nNow we create the necessary document root for Trac (and give it the correct permissions) with the following commands:\n\nsudo mkdir /var/lib/trac sudo mkdir -p /var/ sudo chown /var/\n\nFor our next trick, we create a Trac project directory (we'll call it test) with the command:\n\nsudo trac-admin /var/lib/trac/test initenv test sqlite:db/trac.db\n\nTime to give that new directory the proper permissions. This is done by issuing the following commands:\n\nsudo trac-admin /var/lib/trac/test deploy /var/ sudo chown -R /var/lib/trac/test sudo chown -R /var/\n\nFinally, we create both an admin user and a standard user with the commands:\n\nsudo htdigest -c /var/lib/trac/test/.htdigest \"test\" admin sudo htdigest /var/lib/trac/test/.htdigest \"test\" USER\n\nWhere USER is the name of the user you prefere.\n\nAfter both of the above commands, you'll be prompted to type (and confirm) a password. Remember these passwords.\n\nCreate an Apache .conf file for Trac with the following command:\n\nsudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/trac.conf\n\nAdd the following content to the new file:\n\nWSGIScriptAlias /trac/test /var/ AuthType Digest AuthName \"test\" AuthUserFile /var/lib/trac/test/.htdigest Require valid-user\n\nEnable our new site (and restart Apache) with the following commands:\n\nsudo a2ensite trac sudo systemctl restart apache2\n\nOpen a web browser and point it to (where SERVER_IP is the IP address of your server). You will be prompted for login credentials. Log in with the user admin and the password you set when you created admin user earlier. You can also login with the non-admin user you created. There is actually no difference between the users (which could be a deal-breaker for some). One thing to note: If you need more users, you'll create them from the command line (in similar fashion as you did above). For every user you need to add to Trac, issue the command:\n\nsudo htdigest /var/lib/trac/test/.htdigest \"test\" USER\n\nWhere USER is the username. The above command will add the user to the project test. If you need to create more projects, you must go back through the process of creating a new project directory and then add users to it.\n\nOnce you've successfully authenticated, you'll be presented with the Trac web interface, were you can begin working (Figure A).\n\nYou can now go to Preferences and configure your installation of Trac. Once you've completed that, you can begin creating new tickets. If you get the (please configure the [header_logo] section in trac.ini) error, you can configure this with the command:\n\nsudo nano /var/lib/trac/test/conf/trac.ini\n\n[header_logo] alt = (please configure the [header_logo] section in trac.ini) height = -1 link = src = site/your_project_logo.png width = -1\n\nThat is where you'll configure a header logo to suit your company.\n\nSEE: IT project management: 10 ways to stay under budget (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nYou now have your Trac system up and running. Although you might find systems with more features (and a more powerful configuration system), Trac is very simple to set up and use. If you're looking for a basic ticketing system that can serve as a project management tool, Trac just might fit the bill.\n\nAutomatically sign up for TechRepublic's Open Source Weekly Newsletter for more hot tips and tricks.

    "title": "How to set up a Gitstorage appliance for in-house code collaboration",
    "text": "Git is the largest revision control and collaboration system available for development. Git has replaced larger, more costly systems across the globe and has become the de facto standard tool for coders.\n\nBut for some companies, small or large, housing code on a third-party cloud storage service might be a no-go. If that's the case, the only solution is in-house. For some, that means setting up a server and running a Git repository for the housing of proprietary or open source code. However, for some companies (especially those on the smaller side), having the resources (and time) to set up a server dedicated for Git storage may not be an option. That being the case, what do you do?\n\nFortunately there's a solution, one that's incredibly simple. Said solution is Gitstorage, an easy-to-deploy appliance dedicated to housing your Git repositories. Each appliance is a single board computer (based on the Raspberry Pi). The device is smaller than a credit card, has no moving parts, generates no heat, is wall-mountable, is powered by a standard USB (or included mini USB), and offers a standard ethernet connection. The full specs are:\n\nDimensions - 3.44\" \u00d7 2.93\" \u00d7 1.28\" (87.4 mm \u00d7 74.3 mm \u00d7 32.5 mm)\n\nAmbient temperature - 32 \u00b0F - 104 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C - 40 \u00b0C)\n\nMemory capacity - 16 GB (GS-16) 64 GB (GS-64)\n\nStorage for git repos - 10.6 GB (GS-16) 58.6 GB (GS-64)\n\nProcessor - H2 quadcore Cortex-A7 with 512 MB RAM\n\nConnectors - 1 \u00d7 10/100 MBit/s Ethernet, USB-A, Power (USB Micro-B)\n\nWeb interface languages - English (US), French, German\n\nPrice (MSRP) - $399 USD (GS-16) $499 USD (GS-64)\n\nBut how well does the Gitstorage appliance work? Is it really that easy to deploy? Let's deploy one and find out.\n\nSEE: How to build a successful developer career (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nThe setup of the Gitstorage is remarkably simple:\n\nUnpack the box. Plug the device into your network (you'll need a Cat5 cable). Connect the power cable. Wait 60 seconds.\n\nAt this point, things get a bit complicated. According to the directions, you should then be able to point a browser to and the Gitstorage interface will appear. I tried that on both a Linux desktop and a MacBook Pro. Neither machine could find the device. In fact, if I attempted to ping the gitst.net address, I received a WAN IP address that didn't respond. The only way I was able to reach my Gitstorage device was to log into my router, look for gitstorage among the connected devices, and find out the IP address of the device. Once I had that IP address, I could point my browser to that address and login with user root and password password. At that point, the setup wizard is presented (Figure A).\n\nDevice root CA creation or import (optional)\n\nOnce I completed the wizard, trouble in paradise arose. During the first round, the final screen was blank. After a reboot, I had to walk through the wizard again. This time around the final screen appeared, the All set link didn't work. So I returned to the IP address and was presented with a login screen. I attempted to use the admin email/password I'd setup during the wizard, but that wouldn't work. I then attempted root/password ... again to no avail. After another reboot (unplug, wait a few seconds, plug back in), I was (once again) sent to the setup wizard (only this time, half-way through). Once again, the final screen links wouldn't work.\n\nFortunately, I was sent two devices, so I unplugged the first (a GS-16) and plugged in the second (a GS-64). This time around, everything went smoothly and I was able to log into the Gitstorage interface (Figure B).\n\nFrom the main interface, your first task is to create users. Click on the Users button and add the necessary information for a new user (Figure C).\n\nYou can now create a new repository. However, new repositories can only be created by the Root user. This is a problem. Why? Remember that admin user created during setup? I was unable to login with that user. So the only user with root privileges is root and the password is, well, not even remotely secure. Changing that password isn't nearly as intuitive as you might think (at least not from an admin perspective). Instead of the root user password change option being in the Settings sections, you must click on the Root user button in the upper right corner. From the popup menu (Figure D), click Account.\n\nIn the resulting window, click Password. When prompted, type (and verify) the new password for the root user. Log out and log back in with your new credentials. Now click on the Repositories entry in the left navigation, click the Create button, give the repository a name, and click Submit. Once you've created the repository, click on the Settings entry for it and then click the Add user button, so you can add users to the repository (otherwise the root user will be the only one with access).\n\nSEE: 10 Terminal commands to speed your work on the Mac (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nAnd that's pretty much all there is to setting up a Gitstorage device. Although I did have one hiccup with the first appliance, setting up the second resulted in some pretty smooth sailing for using an in-house Git repository. If you're looking for an incredibly simple solution for code collaboration (and you don't have the resources to setup your own Git server), I highly recommend a Gitstorage device. It's a simple, small, and elegant solution that should serve you well.\n\nAutomatically sign up for TechRepublic's Cloud Insights Newsletter for more hot tips and tricks. Subscribe",

According to recent report from Commvault and CITO Research, 81% of business leaders are embracing the cloud because they're concerned about missing out on cloud advancements.\n\nSo, just how many executives are making that move? According to the report, 93% of respondents said that at least some of their processes were being moved to the cloud. Additionally, 56% said that they had already moved, or intended to move, all of their processes to the cloud.\n\n\"The survey unequivocally confirms that Cloud FOMO is real and on the mind of C-level and other IT leaders who are grappling with bringing the value of this new frontier to their organizations, from increasing IT outcomes to being a strategic driver for increased business agility,\" Dan Woods, CTO of CITO Research, said in the release. \"The research indicates the migration toward the cloud is underway in full force, even as companies struggle to understand cloud capabilities. Data protection and recovery was highlighted as a fundamental area where the cloud is having significant business impact.\"\n\nSEE: Special report: The cloud v. data center decision (free PDF)\n\nDon Foster, senior director of solutions marketing for Commvault, said in the report that cloud technologies are still seen as a key driver for digital transformation. As such, it makes sense that these business leaders would be concerned about getting to the cloud quickly.\n\nThe most important cloud projects cited by the respondents were data protection and backup, and data recovery, as noted by 75% of the respondents and 63% respectively.\n\nHowever, there are some challenges holding these companies back from realizing their cloudy dreams. The sheer volume of data was cited by 68% of those surveyed as a key barrier, while 65% pointed to a struggle with skills and talent, and 55% said policies were the biggest barrier.\n\nThese business leaders are putting their money on the line, too. Some 87% plan on putting more money in their budget for cloud investments.\n\nThe reasons for why these respondents wanted to move to the cloud were varied. Of those surveyed, 33% noted that \"customer focus through business agility\" was their primary reason for moving to the cloud. Cost savings were the primary reason for 22% of respondents and 20% said \"innovation and development of new apps, products and services\" was the driving force behind their cloud journey.\n\nThe 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers\n\nSome 81% of business leaders said that they're moving to the cloud simply out of a fear of missing out on the tech advances provided by the technology, according to a report from Commvault. Of those questioned, 93% said they would be moving at least some of their processes to the cloud, while increasing their budget for it. Increasing agility and customer focus was the main reason for 33% of business leaders to make a move to the cloud.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cloud Insights newsletter.

    "title": "How to request your personal data under GDPR",
    "text": "Building a slide deck, pitch, or presentation? Here are the big takeaways:\n\nIndividuals can get access to all of their data from a given firm, including their employer, by filing a subject access request.\n\nThe GDPR will eliminate the cost for subject access requests and shorten the required response time from 40 days to 30.\n\nThe May 25 deadline for the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is fast-approaching, and the coming changes will greatly shift the ability of companies to interact with customer data.\n\nMany people know the GDPR for its hard-line regulation around the \"right to be forgotten,\" where an individual can request a company to erase the personal data it holds on them. However, it also contains the right to access any information that may be held by a company, including your employer.\n\nThe process for data access under GDPR will be mostly the same as it was under the Data Protection Act of 1998, but with a few slight differences. For starters, a person will need to file a subject access request (SAR) that, as noted by the Guardian, is simply \"an email, fax or letter asking for their personal data.\"\n\nSEE: EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nFor clear guidelines on submitting an SAR, see the Subject access code of practice from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). There is no particular format required, as long as the request is made in writing.\n\nThere are two key differences between SAR requests made under the Data Privacy Act and those made under GDPR: The cost and time frame.\n\nBefore GDPR, the maximum fee that could be charged for access to your data was \u00a310, or about $14. Under GDPR, however, that fee is being removed for standard requests. Although, the ICO also notes that a firm may charge a \"reasonable fee\" when \"a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, particularly if it is repetitive.\"\n\nAccording to SAR guidelines from the ICO, an individual should have the personal data held on them described, be told whether their personal data is being processes, be told why it's being processed, be told if that data is being sent anywhere else, and be given a copy the data and details of its sourcing.\n\nThe other detail that will change with personal data access under GDPR is how long companies have to respond to your request. Under the Data Privacy Act, companies had 40 calendar days to respond once they received a request. Now, however, they will have to provide the data within one month of receiving the request. The company can file for an extension of an extra two months if the \"requests are complex or numerous,\" according to the ICO's right of access page.\n\nIf the request is made electronically, the firm will provide the data in an accessible electronic format. However, the ICO's page notes that GDPR best practices recommend companies establish a secure self-service portal system for easy access.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

    "title": "5 data protection policies your employees must know in the post-GDPR era",
    "text": "The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in May, requiring all organizations that handle the data of EU citizens to comply with its provisions regarding collecting and using personal data. However, a majority of companies likely missed the compliance deadline, and many employees remain unaware of the policies needed to keep data safe.\n\n\"Data privacy is a hot topic with GDPR going into effect,\" said Dave Rickard, technical director at CIPHER Security. \"An awful lot of companies may not think they have exposure to it, but there are lots of variables in that.\"\n\nFor example, one online retailer Rickard works with has many customers from the EU, but can't geolocate them from the website. Others don't work with EU citizens, but have data processing and storage facilities there, which are also subject to GDPR.\n\nSEE: EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nGDPR will likely influence data privacy policies in other countries, Rickard said. However, cultural differences, particularly between the EU and US, may make this difficult.\n\n\"In the EU people are very centered on the perspective that 'My name, my social security number, my passport information, everything that is PII about me, belongs to me. It's part of my individuality,'\" he said. \"Whereas in North America, people have long since taken the perspective instead that data is currency. There are so many business models that are built on it. Data is money.\"\n\nThe majority of companies that need to be compliant with GDPR are not yet, Rickard said. \"I'd say compliance right now is only at about 35% or 40% at the most,\" he said. \"I think a lot of people are taking a wait and see approach.\"\n\nSome of the bigger players like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are going to be the canaries in the coal mine, Rickard said. \"I think that they'll have actions taken on them first, and people are going to wait and see if the actual GDPR penalties play out the way that they've been published.\"\n\nCompanies that fail to comply with GDPR will face a penalty of either 4% of their global revenue or \u20ac20 million, whichever is greater.\n\nHere are five types of policies that companies must ensure they have in place and have trained employees on in the age of GDPR, according to Rickard.\n\nMost companies lack policies around data encryption, Rickard said. \"Most people who are data owners are unaware of whether their data is encrypted at rest or not,\" he added. \"GDPR is big on encryption at rest.\"\n\nSEE: Encryption policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nAn acceptable use policy should covers things like what applications are allowed, what web searching and social media habits are appropriate for the business, and the potential threats to brand reputation, Rickard said.\n\nPasswords remain a common digital entry point into an organization for hackers. Even if, in the best case scenario, employees use complex passwords that are changed often and not shared, human error and carelessness can still put a business at risk. \"One of the easiest ways to breach a company is to put somebody on the janitorial staff and go looking at desks,\" Rickard said. \"People often have Post-it notes on monitors with passwords on them.\"\n\nIT should have an email policy in place that hardens systems and can detect spam and viruses, Rickard said. \"The kind of information that can be disclosed via email should be spelled out very clearly,\" he added.\n\nCompanies need to do data process flow mapping to see what data is being collected, how it's being processed, and who is receiving processed copies, Rickard said. \"GDPR closes all those gaps,\" he added.\n\nEmployee training is paramount for ensuring these policies are enforced, Rickard said. Raising awareness of the threat landscape and common vulnerabilities can help counteract human error.\n\n\"Security awareness and training is the cornerstone of any security program,\" he added.\n\nFor tips on how to best train employees on cybersecurity practices, click here.\n\nStay up to date on all the latest cybersecurity threats.

    "title": "Why a cloud-friendly Java could finally be possible with Jakarta EE",
    "text": "Over the past two decades, Java has arguably been the most successful programming language on the planet. Go is cool, Swift is nifty, but old-school Java keeps reinventing itself to power both yesterday's and tomorrow's applications.\n\nDepending on how you count, some 14 million Java programmers code today, with many of them paid well to maintain massive enterprise applications (an estimated 80% of enterprise workloads run on Java). Redmonk, in its latest Q1 2018 survey, says Java is the second-most popular language after JavaScript among developers.\n\nNot that Java lacks challenges. For example, Java is perhaps the most divisive technology in the industry-a morass of competing vendors with a constipated governance model that excludes much more than it includes. In this way, Java has left obvious gaps and frustration for developers who need a bridge to a cloud-native future.\n\nSEE: Job description: Java developer (Tech Pro Research)\n\nTo ease that frustration, Tuesday the Eclipse Foundation unveiled new directions for Java EE under the recently-named-by-community-vote Jakarta EE Working Group, the successor to Java EE (which remains licensed by Oracle and maintained under the JCP).\n\nJava, cloud-friendly? It just might happen.\n\nThe one thing everyone agrees about Java is that it's imperfect. And yet there's hope. No longer your grandparent's Cobol, what if a vibrant community embraced Jakarta EE and pushed it much faster than any Java EE before? Under the Eclipse Foundation's guidance, we may finally get the power of open source collaboration to build on the best of Java's two decades of work. Through this new Jakarta EE Working Group process, we should see big Java EE vendors like IBM, Red Hat, and Oracle working within the open processes of the Eclipse Foundation with smaller vendors like Tomitribe and Payara.\n\nIn this world, there's no single vendor to impose its will on Java. Instead, we may finally get a true code meritocracy where Java communities and individuals function as peers. Instead of a divisive force, Jakarta EE could become a catalyst to join disparate Java communities behind a shared goal. In this case, my bet is on a race to some version of cloud-native implementation for Jakarata EE.\n\nYou can read all the details on the new Eclipse Foundation governance model online but for me, it's much more interesting to see where the community wants to go. To the credit of the Eclipse Foundation, they surveyed more than 1,800 Java developers worldwide to take the pulse of the Java community. Under Oracle's (or Sun's) control, this sort of community outreach simply didn't happen (though, to its credit, Oracle made the decision to move Java to the Eclipse Foundation's stewardship).\n\nIn the survey, the Eclipse Foundation learned that the three most critical areas that developers want Jakarta EE to prioritize are:\n\nBetter support for microservices (60%) Native integration with Kubernetes (57%) Faster pace of innovation (47%)\n\nSEE: How to build a successful developer career (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nAlmost half (45%) of the Java developers surveyed are already building microservices, with more (21%) planning to do so within the next 12 months. Add to this the fact that half of these developers currently only run a fifth of their Java applications in the cloud but 30% say they'll run 60% or more of their applications in the cloud, and it's clear how much pent-up demand there is for a more cloud-friendly Java. To get there, roughly a third of the developers surveyed have embraced Kubernetes. This is a cloud-savvy crowd that needs their preferred programming model to keep pace with their ambitions.\n\nNone of this was a surprise, of course. Java developers aren't living in a cloud-free world. Developers want a framework of tools that helps them be more successful using the Java skills they already have to build next-generation, cloud native applications. With the new Jakarta EE, they just might get their wish.\n\nClick here to subscribe to TechRepublic's Cloud Insights newsletter. Subscribe",

    "text": "High demand and low supply of IT professionals may lead to turnover in the new year, a new report found. Some 32% of IT professionals said they plan to search for or take an IT job with a new employer in 2018, according to Spiceworks' 2018 IT Career Outlook.\n\nAmong those planning to make a job move, 75% said they are seeking a better salary, 70% said they want to advance their skills, and 39% said they want to work for a company that prioritizes IT more than the one they currently work for.\n\nOf the 2,163 IT professionals from North America and Europe surveyed, 7% said they plan to start working as a consultant, while 5% said they plan to leave the IT industry altogether. Another 2% reported plans to retire in 2018.\n\nSome employees said they expect positive changes from their current employer in the new year: 51% of IT professionals said they expect a raise from their current employer next year, while 21% said they also expect a promotion. However, 24% said they don't expect any career changes or raises in the next year.\n\nSEE: IT jobs 2018: Hiring priorities, growth areas, and strategies to fill open roles (Tech Pro Research)\n\nMillennials in particular (36%) were more likely to say they were seeking new employment-more than Gen Xers (32%) and baby boomers (23%). Millennial IT professionals are also more likely to leave their current employer to find a better salary, advance their skills, work for a more talented team, and receive better employee perks than older employees. Meanwhile, Gen X IT professionals are more likely to leave their jobs to seek a better work-life balance, while baby boomers are more likely to leave due to burnout.\n\nDespite those who plan to leave their jobs, 70% of IT professionals say they are satisfied with their current jobs-though 63% say they believe they are underpaid, the report found. This number is even higher among millennials: 68% of millennial IT workers feel underpaid, compared to 60% of Gen X and 61% of baby boomers.\n\nIn terms of salary, millennial IT professionals are paid a median income of $50,000 per year, while Gen X IT professionals are paid $65,000, and baby boomers are paid $70,000. These salaries also correlate to years of experience, the report noted.\n\nIn terms of tech skills needed to be successful in any IT job in the coming year, 81% of IT professionals reported that cybersecurity expertise was critical.\n\nDespite understanding how critical this area is, only 19% of IT pros reported having advanced cybersecurity knowledge-potentially putting organizations at risk. This echoes previous research about the dearth of cybersecurity professionals currently available to companies, as well as the need to upskill employees to fill security gaps.\n\nSEE: Cheat sheet: How to become a cybersecurity pro\n\nAbout 75% of IT professionals also said that it was critical to have experience in networking, infrastructure hardware, end-user devices, and storage and backup. Of these, 41% said they have advanced networking skills, 50% said they have advanced infrastructure hardware skills, and 79% said they are advanced in supporting and troubleshooting end user devices, including laptops, desktops, and tablets.\n\n\"Although the majority of IT professionals are satisfied with their jobs, many also believe they should be making more money, and will take the initiative to find an employer who is willing to pay them what they're worth in 2018,\" Peter Tsai, senior technology analyst at Spiceworks, said in a press release. \"Many IT professionals are also motivated to change jobs to advance their skills, particularly in cybersecurity.

    "title": "How to protect your company from tax season phishing scams",
    "text": "Unfortunately, it seems there's a phishing scheme to go along with virtually every event in life, whether a holiday, a tragedy, or an annual ritual. Tax time is not exempt, so to speak.\n\nWhether you work in finance or you support users who do, it's important to be on the lookout this tax season for phishing schemes geared towards obtaining confidential information from unsuspecting individuals.\n\nA common phishing attempt involves compromised or spoofed emails which purport to be from an executive at your organization and are sent either to human resources or finance/payroll employees. The email requests a list of employees and their related W-2 forms.\n\nThat's not all, however. Another common scam (which can occur throughout the year) involves receiving a phone call from an individual claiming to be from the IRS (caller ID can be spoofed to show this as well) who informs you that you owe money for back taxes and often threatens law enforcement retribution if payment (usually via credit card over the phone) isn't provided.\n\nThe IRS will never call you on the phone to report you owe them money nor demand money over the phone; they utilize the postal service for such notifications. They also will not engage in threats and are supposed to provide an opportunity for you to work constructively with them or negotiate payment.\n\nSEE: IT leader's guide to cyberattack recovery (Tech Pro Research)\n\nWhat standard protection methods should be used?\n\nThe typical safeguards against phishing can protect you and your employees; establish a policy against requesting confidential information through email, call people directly to verify such requests, arrange for secure transfer of data, and limit the number of employees who possess the authority to access or handle W-2 forms.\n\nThe IRS also recommends contacting them about any malicious activity. Phishing attempts can be reported to If someone from your company has given out W-2 information, contact with a description of what happened and how many employees were affected. Also make sure not to attach any confidential information!\n\nIf your company is contacted by scammers claiming you owe the IRS money, report it via the IRS Impersonation Scam Reporting webpage. You can also call 800-366-4484. You should also report this to the Federal Trade Commission via the FTC Complaint Assistant on FTC.gov.\n\nEducation and establishing proper procedures can be helpful in minimizing risk, but I also highly recommend using technology to safeguard data as well. While both technology and humans may be prone to failure, technology is harder to fool or take advantage of.\n\nWith that in mind, data loss prevention (DLP) can be a handy tool in combating phishing gimmicks of this nature. DLP systems examine traffic coming in and out of an organization: emails, instant messages, web access - anything that is sent over the network. These systems can sniff out confidential information such as Social Security numbers and block them from being transmitted.\n\nThis comes with a potential cost, however; legitimate traffic may end up blocked, such as when employees email tax information to their tax preparers or their own personal accounts. This can pose a challenge for DLP systems (and those responsible for administering them) in separating the wheat from the chaff. The end result is undoubtedly a slew of false positives with frustrated and/or confused employees.\n\nSEE: Intrusion detection policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nAnother potential solution is user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA). UEBA can determine the likelihood the employee is sending tax information to themselves via their personal email address by analyzing behavioral patterns to determine the legitimacy of specific activities.\n\nFor example, if an employee named Ray Donovan sends a W-2 form from his corporate email address to his Gmail address UEBA can determine that it's highly likely this information is being sent to the same person and will not send a critical alert nor block the transmission. It helps if Ray has a history of sending himself emails of this nature so UEBA can mark that behavior as normal.\n\nHowever, in a genuine phishing scenario where Ray sends a W-2 form to an email address he has not previously contacted, UEBA could determine that it's not the same person, analyze further using behavioral comparisons and send alerts or take action as necessary.\n\nWhat about a situation where an employee is emailing confidential information to themselves when they shouldn't (such as someone else's W-2 form, or their own despite company policies prohibiting this)? UEBA can still send alerts which can then result in investigational activity and appropriate discipline as needed, including termination. Making employees aware that this activity is analyzed and monitored can serve as a deterrent and ensure confidential information remains in appropriate hands.\n\nFor more security tips and news, subscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

    "title": "Are smart locks secure? AV-TEST has the answer",
    "text": "Smart locks began appearing on doors when building automation and the Internet of Things (IoT) went mainstream. However, the public's acceptance of smart locks has been less than stellar-initial cost vs. actual benefits are seemingly the primary reason why.\n\nThe low adoption of smart locks may soon change if the powers that be at Amazon have their way. The company recently introduced Amazon Key, a remotely-controlled building-access platform-consisting of Amazon's Cloud Cam, a compatible smart lock, and smartphone app (shown to the right)-that allows Amazon-approved delivery personnel to open locked doors and leave deliveries inside the customer's home or office. A slew of additional conveniences not related to package delivery may also help the acceptance of smart locks.\n\nThat said, the public's interest in smart locks will only improve if the benefits outweigh the costs, and the technology is proven to be physically safe and electronically secure.\n\nSecurity issues have already been reported about Amazon Key. Liam Tung in his ZDNet article Amazon: We're fixing a flaw that leaves Key security camera open to Wi-Fi jamming writes, \"A malicious courier could easily freeze the Key's Cloud Cam and roam a customer's house unmonitored.\"\n\nConcerns about smart locks and security were raised way back in 2013. My TechRepublic article High-tech home security products: Who are they really helping? quotes several experts who question the security of smart locks and the technology supporting them.\n\nSEE: Internet of Things Policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nAV-TEST put six smart locks' data security through their paces\n\nKnowing what experts were saying about smart-lock systems four years ago and the likelihood of smart locks becoming popular, the people at AV-TEST, an independent IT-security testing lab, decided to see if things have improved. The lab's engineers developed a test program and put these six smart locks through their paces:\n\nBurg-Wachter secuENTRY easy 501 (Germany)\n\neQ-3 Equiva Bluetooth Smart Lock (Germany)\n\nData security was the first thing considered by the engineers with special emphasis on acquisition, storage, and transmission of data; the following image depicts how they employed Wireshark to capture traffic between the smart lock being tested and the controlling smartphone application. Besides communications, the team examined each system's hardware and software, tested the software-update process, and determined whether the associated smart-lock application had any security issues.\n\nIt seems smart locks have improved considerably in the past four-plus years. From the AV-TEST report: \"Convenience does not have to mean less security. This reassuring conclusion can be made following the surprisingly strong results of the smart-lock testing.\" Concerning the test results, the test engineers offer the following insights.\n\nInstallation: Despite physical differences, all smart locks evaluated by AV-TEST installed easily-systems manufactured by eQ-3 and Nuki being the easiest.\n\nLocal communications: All tested smart locks are locally activated via Bluetooth. \"As a standard feature, the smart locks use encryption, mostly AES with at least 128 bits,\" mentions the report. \"Three locks, August, Danalock, and Nuki can encrypt at a higher rate-AES with 256 bits.\"\n\nThe AV-TEST engineers report that smart locks by August, Danalock, and Nuki can integrate with local Wi-Fi networks; this allows location-independent remote control using the mobile device's smart-lock app. According to the report, neither Bluetooth nor SSL-encrypted Wi-Fi connections introduce any detectable vulnerabilities.\n\nData protection: AV-TEST's engineers measured each smart lock's privacy policy against European data-protection law. One concern centered on whether systems save more data than what is needed to operate properly. From the report: \"For August, Danalock, and Noke, the testers see a need for improvement, e.g., in terms of information on stored data and its use by third parties. An adaptation to European data-protection law would easily remedy these defects.\"\n\nSEE: Cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (free PDF) (ZDNet/TechRepublic special report)\n\nSmartphone-app security: The report warns that apps are a potential target for attackers, in particular how each app manages access permissions and log files. All smart-lock systems but August and Danalock handled access and log files adequately. The engineers are concerned that August and Danalock generate comprehensive debug logs that provide clues to how the app functions. Additionally, August keeps debug logs in a protected area, whereas Danalock does not, making it possible to read the log files using tools like Android Logcat. The report suggests both August and Danalock need to improve security in this area.\n\nOne serious misstep: The AV-TEST paper took issue with the smart lock from Burg-Wachter because the lock system does not require the user to change the default admin password. \"A dangerous complacency, as IoT devices with unchanged default login details are easy prey for attackers,\" mentions the report.\n\nEach smart lock was rated on local communications, external communications, app security, and data protection, with three stars holding top honors. The following graph shows the overall results.\n\nOn a positive note, the AT-TEST report notes, \"All in all, it appears the manufacturers of smart door locks, unlike many other manufacturers of smart home products, did their homework.\"\n\nThe report concludes by saying, \"The AV-TEST Institute rated five out of six of the locking systems evaluated in the quick test as having solid basic security with theoretical vulnerabilities at the most.\"\n\nStay informed about IT security news, tips, and tutorials-subscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

    "title": "Top 5: Things AI might actually be good for",
    "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly mocked as being used as a marketing term. But AI is also being used to create some legitimately useful tools. So, to beat back some of the less useful uses of the term, here are five things AI might actually be good for:\n\nFarmLogs is an example of complex data analysis that tracks weather, soil conditions, historical satellite imagery and helps farmers determine what kind of plant growth to expect and how to maximize crop yields.\n\nSEE: Farming for the future: How one company uses big data to maximize yields and minimize impact (TechRepublic)\n\nWatson made this use of AI famous, and while you can debate its effectiveness, others like Intel are working on things like precision medicine. Machine learning can compare molecular tests with previous cases to customize treatments. Computer interpretation of medical images as an aid to diagnosis is also making rapid advances.\n\nSEE: Beware AI's magical promises, as seen in IBM Watson's underwhelming cancer play (TechRepublic)\n\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is experimenting with AI to help automate and speed up scanning websites for suspicious content.\n\nSEE: IT leader's guide to deep learning (Tech Pro Research)\n\nAI can help sort through resumes and rank candidates.

AI can be used to process natural language and route people to the right agent and even listen in and prompt agents with queries and responses.\n\nWe didn't even include autonomous cars, which use all kinds of machine learning and types of AI to interpret sensors. And there are loads more. There's a lot of fog around the idea of AI these days, but if you look closely you can see some pretty good examples of the real thing.\n\nFor more about artificial intelligence and other innovations, subscribe to our Next Big Thing newsletter.

    "title": "How 5G will power innovations in VR and artificial intelligence",
    "text": "Manish Vyas, president of business communication at Tech Mahindra, spoke with TechRepublic's Dan Patterson about innovations that will be enabled by the arrival of 5G.\n\nWatch the video, or read the full transcript of their conversation below:\n\nPatterson: Help us understand, Manish, 5G we hear a lot of hype about. What's the reality of this new wireless standard?\n\nVyas: The reality is that it does promise us to transform. You very rightly use the word digital, but my translation of digital is it promises to change the way people would live, work, and play going forward in a more significant fashion than what you saw with the previous generations.\n\nIf I could just expand on that a bit, 5G is not just about the throughput and the speed and the power and the latencies, but 5G is about exciting, exciting propositions that will come our way both in the enterprise space and in the consumer domain. Given that 5G also combined with some of the other later technological innovations that are happening as we speak, for example, artificial intelligence, will just enable a certain set of use cases. It will just change the paradigm of how people communicate, how people consume experiences, or how people transact business. All of that is going to change, so I guess that's the reason why everybody is so hyped up, if I may, about 5G.\n\nPatterson: So, how? We know that the capabilities of 2G, 3G, and 4G has iterated and created new technological capabilities. What specifically about 5G enables IoT, enables high-speed mobile devices, and enables artificial intelligence?\n\nVyas: Yes. I think it is, and all of them are related, the convergence of other software technologies that are advancing at the speed of light right now. Let's take two of them, just to build a use case, right? Let's take VR, virtual reality. Let's take IoT, which is the ability to connect the devices and harness the power of data, right? Now, combine that with the wireless advancements that will happen with the 5G technology from an access, as well as from how the data is processed. It will create use cases that have hereto not been possible.\n\nSEE: Virtual and augmented reality policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nOne of my favorite examples that I often give is think of an NFL game, and think of the tailgate parties that happen outside any stadium. There are any number of thousands of people who are perennial tailgate party goers. They don't even enter the stadium game after game, year after year, but they like to spend a lot of money outside the stadium.\n\nThe experience that they will now get, imagine with the VR and with the discoverable aspect of the network that 5G does, where if you, Dan, for example, as a big fan of a certain running back of a certain NFL team, as you're partying with your buddies outside a certain stadium, you will be notified that something dramatic happened inside the stadium and with whatever device that is available at the time, which is also by the way advancing, with 5G and with the fact that you are discoverable by the network and the latencies and the availability of the network is like never before, the throughout is like never before, so the IoT on a camera or a device, the VR experience, powered by 5G, you will there and then and you will be the only person who will be able to stand almost right next to the running back and experience as the things explode and happen at the site.\n\nJust the sheer power of that use case is phenomenal, and the money that different people in the ecosystem will make out of it, including the telecom service provider, I think can be quite an interesting paradigm in my view.\n\nPatterson: What are some of the challenges or roadblocks to the rollout of 5G?\n\nVyas: I think there are plenty. One of the biggest ones is going to be, without even getting into the technology aspect at this point, I would say is still a major part of the industry will still struggle to find the justification to invest in the capital, from a business case ROI standpoint.\n\nNow, on that one, one is also hearing as I go around the world and meet different CTOs and other executives of service providers, one is hearing that there are different ways of skinning that cat, if I may. The overall cost of 5G deployment is likely to be atmospherically high at this point, there are all indicators that the likely cost is going to be cheaper than what was in 4G, and if that happens, that itself is probably a business case-justification.\n\nSEE: IT pro's guide to the evolution and impact of 5G technology (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nOf course, there is a bigger underlying assumption that the prices in the marketplace at least hold up, and if they drop, they drop only marginally and not dramatically. There's no guarantee of that, but at least that's a possibility. That's one challenge, clearly that the market is going to face.\n\nThe second is going to be a more technical and execution challenge, which is the availability of the technology, the trials that need to go through in a very satisfactory fashion worldwide so that people get enough confidence to go and deploy the technology at a very large scale, which I don't think is a question of if, it is more a question of when. I guess the challenge would be more for delay rather than really making it happen.\n\nPatterson: Manish, I think that that is a great point. I wonder if you could leave us with say, the next 18- to 36-months in the rollout of 5G. Where are we in a year, year and a half, and where are we in three or four years?\n\nVyas: I would say in three to four years time, I would be surprised if the world is not entirely enabled by 5G. When I say that with a sense of responsibility that there would be still be a certain set of companies that may not adopt it, because of how they would want to position it, which would be challenging, and they would be under tremendous pressure, but I believe that in the next three to four years, as the other technologies also evolve, the other software technologies, I believe in the next three to four years, we will see a very large scale deployment worldwide.\n\nIn the imminent short-term, the 18, 20 months, I think we will see the early adopters clearly making progress. This year alone, we might see some of the major tier-one service providers in the North American continent, we will see them doing about 12 to 15 trials. By that, I mean 12 to 15 locations or cities would be 5G-enabled by the end of the year.\n\nFor more about the latest tech innovations, subscribe to our Next Big Thing newsletter. Subscribe",

    "text": "Writing bug-free software is practically impossible, due to the impracticality of predicting every way in which code might be executed.\n\nBut even if developers go above and beyond to avoid flaws that can be exploited by hackers, attackers can often still take advantage of vulnerabilities in the design of the underlying programming language.\n\nAt the recent Black Hat Europe conference, IOActive security services revealed it had identified flaws in five major, interpreted programming languages that could be used by hackers in crafting an attack.\n\n\"With regards to the interpreted programming languages vulnerabilities, software developers may unknowingly include code in an application that can be used in a way that the designer did not foresee,\" it writes.\n\nSEE: Hiring kit: Python developer (Tech Pro Research)\n\n\"Some of these behaviors pose a security risk to applications that were securely developed according to guidelines.\"\n\nThese are the five programming languages and the flaws that were identified:\n\nCurrently enjoying a surge in usage, Python is regularly used by web and desktop developers, sysadmin/devops, and more recently by data scientists and machine-learning engineers.\n\nThe IOActive paper found that Python contains undocumented methods and local environment variables that can be used to execute operating-system commands.\n\nBoth Python's mimetools and pydoc libraries have undocumented methods that can be exploited in this way, which IOActive used to run Linux's id command.\n\nPopular for web server scripting, sysadmin jobs, network programming and automating various tasks, Perl has been in use since the late 1980s.\n\nIOActive highlights the fact that Perl contains a function that will attempt to execute one of the arguments passed to it as Perl code. It describes the practice as a \"hidden feature\" within a default Perl function for handling typemaps.\n\nNodeJS provides a server-side environment for executing JavaScript, the language commonly used for scripting in web browsers.\n\nIOActive found that NodeJS' built-in error messages for its require function could be exploited to determine whether a file name existed on the machine and to leak the first line of files on a system-potentially useful information for an attacker.\n\nThe Java implementation of the Ruby programming language was found to allow remote code execution in a way that isn't possible in Ruby as a base language.\n\nBy calling executable Ruby code using a specific function in JRuby, IOActive was able to get the function to execute an operating system command, the Linux command id, by loading a file on a remote server.\n\nThe venerable server scripting language was used to call an operating system command, again the Linux command id, using the shell_exec() function and exploiting the way PHP handles the names of constants.\n\n\"Depending on how the PHP application has been developed, this may lead to remote command execution,\" say researchers.\n\nThat said, many web admins have long known the potential risk posed by PHP's shell_exec() function, and how to disable it.\n\nExploitable flaws in each programming language were identified using a tool called a differential fuzzer, which was designed to automatically find vulnerabilities. The fuzzer works by running through a large array of scenarios in each language, calling each of the languages' native functions with a wide variety of different arguments and observing the results.\n\nKeep up to date on all of the newest tech trends.

    "title": "How the blockchain could help build a decentralized media economy",
    "text": "Jarrod Dicker, CEO of Po.et, talked with Dan Patterson about how his company uses the blockchain to document media assets.\n\nWatch the video, or read the full transcript of their conversation below:\n\nPatterson: The decentralized media economy is here. What the heck is a decentralized media economy? Well, surprise, surprise, it runs on the blockchain. ... You have worked at The Washington Post, as well as RebelMouse and other media companies. First, why a startup? Why a blockchain startup? And, why Po.et?\n\nDicker: Three of the most frequent questions I get. So why a startup? I think my past three years at The Washington Post have been somewhat startup in a legacy media news organization, and the fact that we were run by Jeff Bezos, who owns the Post. It was an amazing time for news, right, and all news media.\n\nThere was a lot of momentum and excitement behind all the work that we were doing. Especially when we took it to the tech side. And one thing that I've always focused on throughout my career was how do we build a better model for the business of media, which is what I found extremely hard to do. It's also extremely hard to do within just one media company.\n\nSo over the past few years, I've been building something at The Washington Post called RED, Research Experimentation Development, where we were building new technologies and systems to use on the Post, off the Post, licensed white label to really help build a better media economy. Then I started really understanding not just the technologies behind blockchain, but the philosophies behind them.\n\nThe idea of consensus and decentralization. Coincidentally, Po.et approached me in terms of going there, becoming the chief executive officer, and building the team. We could get into how that all went down, but that's how I ended up here now.\n\nPatterson: So the blockchain, this is possibly one of the most hyped technologies in recent memory. But it really is useful when you have to stamp a piece of asset, whatever that asset is. No matter whether it's gold and diamonds, or housing and real estate, or in this case, content. So a lot of us in media on the backend, we have content management systems and you can see a log of activity that is not necessarily for the public, but you can see what happens to a particular asset over time.\n\nWhy is a blockchain good for public pieces of media? And when I say assets, in this case we're referring to a post, or a video, or an audio podcast. Why is the blockchain so good at documenting those types of assets?\n\nDicker: Yeah, I think for one, a quick answer is the idea of immutability, right. The idea that something could be permanent and stored there. Mainly for attribution, being able to check to see who the owner of an idea is, whose authorship of a certain idea, and just make sure that that cannot be manipulated. I think that that's extremely important, but scary for a lot of media companies.\n\nI've had a couple conversations where folks in media have said, \"Well, that's terrifying because what if I need to redact a statement?\" Right, or what if I need to take something down for advertisements? And where I think we'll see the value of blockchain in media is also like philosophically how we change the way that we think and build content and creative ideas in the media landscape. What I mean by that is right now, we are used to a web, where we can delete, where we can change, and where we can alter.\n\nAnd what's really happened there is that people throw ideas out there, knowing that if they are wrong, they could change or delete, or things are not immutable, right, per se, which is what's happening on the blockchain. What I really hope beyond just the products of what it can do, is really that it'll change the way that we do things, right. Like in society today, there are consequences for things that you do. You can't just press the delete button or change, right. So you think about these sort of things before you actually act on them.\n\nAnd I think what we've seen in the media landscape is that people are very quick to send ideas or shoot ideas out there, knowing that they can hide behind something, or knowing that they could change something. And what does it really mean when you need to kind of account for those ideas, and when they are living on a blockchain forever? So one of which, when it comes to media on the blockchain, I think is this idea of security, immutability.\n\nSEE: What is blockchain? Understanding the technology and the revolution (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nThis new notion that you are now in control of your ideas and of your assets, both in a public and private, public key, private key manner. And being able to take control of that, right. We at Po.et, really want to focus more on the long tail creators, like we are accessible for everyone. We aim to be a library of the world's creative assets on the blockchain and are building different ways for access and people to do so. Whether that's through, as you mentioned, a content management system, or going directly to Po.et, or within your own domains.\n\nBut once you do that, what can you actually do on the domain? And I think there's two major things. One is really being able to own and manage your ideas. So how do you issue a content license? What should that cost? How can you make sure that your ideas are being heard and transacted on? An example that I give often and we see it every single day on Twitter, is that if you put something up on Twitter, which is a piece of media that can go viral beyond just the at replies, there's also Huffington Post, and BuzzFeed, and others saying, \"Hey, Dan. I love this. Do you mind if I use this?\"\n\nAnd at that moment, you really have already put it on Twitter and you just assume, \"Sure, right. It's already out there.\" Well, what if you had the opportunity to say, \"Oh, there's clearly value in this content I'm creating. Sure, here's my private key with the smart contract and rules that you need to abide by if you want to license and leverage this content.\"\n\nSo that is one thing that I think is extremely important that we'll learn both in terms of changing a behavior about applications of using blockchain for media. The other is this idea of transparency, as you mentioned, and reputation, right. In everything that we do in life, reputation matters. Like if you go to a hotel, you're going to look at the ratings. If you ride in an Uber, you look at ratings. Every single thing is based on that transparency and reputation. Even if you're going to eat something, right.\n\nTruth could be subjective, information could be subjective. Like the same way that you would look at maybe the back of a carton of milk and say, \"Okay, there's a lot of fat, but I'm cool with it.\" Or, you may say, \"No, like I don't want all that fat.\" But when it comes to information and transparency, that doesn't really exist. So I think this idea of building reputation for creators, not just to say, \"That this creator tells the truth and this creator doesn't tell the truth.\" But just give transparency as to the way that they navigate it-\n\nPatterson: Yeah, ownership and the attribution-\n\nDicker: Exactly, and be able to see, has it been fact checked? Right, who has seen it? Has this person published before? They've taken this picture in Sri Lanka, are they actually in Sri Lanka? Right, or are they in New Jersey? So I think that sort of information really is applicable, especially nowadays, when it comes to deep fakes and people putting information out there, to really just get more exposure and transparency to the end consumer, so that they can make decisions on their own based on what they're consuming.\n\nPatterson: Yeah, so the obvious use cases could be say, iStock photo and allowing creators to control the assets that are there. But also social media, as well as news content, or almost any piece of content where an exchange of trust has to happen. And really what you're talking about with transparency, is the exchange of trust equity. And being able to say, \"This is the process by which a particular asset exists in an ecosystem, and you can vet and verify it using the blockchain.\" So you use the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nPatterson: Yeah, so explain to me how that applies to Po.et, not just in terms of content, but you are building a content library. Why did you elect to use Ethereum? What are some of the advantages of that? And, is this the next emerging hot blockchain?\n\nDicker: So I want to back up and just make it clear. We stamp on the Bitcoin blockchain because it's the most secure blockchain. We leverage Ethereum for ERC-20 tokens because Po.et is a token dynamic-type model. In that, to build reputation, we need to build incentive systems, and that's why the Po.et token exists to help fuel and challenge the marketplace in order to get the best content up and the worst content down.\n\nI think with Ethereum, the most interesting thing that's happening is that they are opening up with these ERC-20 tokens and beyond, the opportunity for people to build their technologies on top of it. And that's where you've kind of seen a huge movement towards that blockchain and the opportunities of that blockchain. There's also companies like ConsenSys out in Bushwick, that are building right on top of this, companies for every single pocket of the industry that could leverage blockchain for proof, right, of value and really what it could really become.\n\nThat is definitely happening to answer your question. Like that trend is moving and there's a lot of accessibility there. Now that being said, we're way off, right, from building scalable blockchain solutions when it comes to enterprise and conversations that we would have had three years ago when I was at The Washington Post in talking about technologies built there. So that is somewhat exciting because I don't believe that we are dead set on one blockchain for anything.\n\nSEE: Blockchain: An insider's guide (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nPo.et's ambitions and the partnerships that we have and others that are building on top of the work that we're doing, are kind of opening up the same opportunity. Look, Po.et is build a protocol that is helping build reputation on the web. And if you want to help leverage that, to help build reputation within your applications, then you should build on Po.et. There's a company called Encrypt that's building on top of Po.et, which is really looking to circumvent censorship when it comes to information delivery.\n\nSo if you are posting an article or have a website, and you are concerned that your IP could be blocked, how can you leverage Encrypt to make sure that that information is then spread out in a bunch of different devices and not just one central server? To then be able to come back and have that information delivered, and that's something that's being built on top of Po.et. There's other conversations of people in media that are looking for certain solutions that want to build on top of what we're doing, as well.\n\nSo we leverage Bitcoin blockchain just because it's an easy marketing example to say, \"Look. If you value your money and you trust Bitcoin blockchain because money is the most important thing to you at this moment, well, your ideas are equally important, right? And if your ideas are important, you want them to be as secure as your money.\" But there are opportunities for us to port to either. There's opportunities for us to mimic or build our own.\n\nI think it's still early days, but the biggest thing that we're looking to do now is influence a space that could benefit from new thinking, right, the business of media really trying to figure out how to strengthen media companies, how to allow them to evolve, how can get we give power back to creators, right?\n\nHow do we give velocity to independent thought and a platform, where people could drive revenue and earn what they should earn, based off their ideas? An analogy ... Or, sorry. I hate sports analogies, but an analogy-\n\nDicker: And hopefully, the audience does, as well. But the way that free agency works in sports, right, does not really exist when it comes to media or content. So each writer is somewhat valued the same. I mean, we look at certain nuances like Twitter followers, or tenure, right, or work that they've completed.\n\nBut in sports, you have this opportunity where every single quarterback is rated, right, in front of the public based on their skillset, based on their salaries, based on all these different set of criteria.\n\nIn media, that really doesn't exist, right. So what if we can build these sort of valuations and services to set up, so that we can actually pinpoint the value of content and the value of media that everyone is creating, which personally, I believe is extremely undervalued right now.\n\nAnd I'm sure you agree, as well, and anyone who works in this space constantly is telling people that, \"Content cost money. Content is valuable. It costs a lot to create great content. If you want good content, you need to pay for it.\"\n\nBut I think what we need to do is start proving these things, and in order to prove these things, we need to set up dynamics and platforms in order to do so, and that's kind of what we're doing here.\n\nFor more on blockchain and other world-changing technology, subscribe to our Next Big Thing newsletter.

    "title": "Windows 10 wishlist: Five gripes Microsoft needs to take seriously",
    "text": "Microsoft is constantly tinkering with Windows 10, dropping in new features and swapping out old ones, but there are a few annoyances it seems unable or unwilling to fix.\n\nWhat ties most of the following complaints together is Microsoft's reluctance to let users choose for themselves, preferring instead to try to coerce users and control how they use their computer.\n\nHere are the five ways Windows 10 is broken that Microsoft needs to sort out.\n\n1. Sort out the Control Panel / Settings app confusion\n\nWindows 10 adopts a rather confused approach to managing settings-splitting the options between the legacy Control Panel and the Settings app.\n\nMicrosoft appears to be in the process of gradually migrating these options to the new Settings app, with each big feature update further diminishing the role of the Control Panel.\n\nHowever, having to juggle between the two menus is not particularly user friendly, and the changes in where settings lie is particularly aggravating for some users, as can be seen by the large number of forum posts this issue generates.\n\nYou can use the Search function to locate the Settings you need, but there are still clearly a large number of users who still struggle to locate what they're looking for.\n\nAll Windows 10 users should be given control over when updates are applied.\n\nCurrently there is no simple option for Windows 10 Home users to defer updates in the same way there is for users of Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise editions.\n\nSEE: Windows 10: Streamline your work with these power tips (free TechRepublic PDF)\n\nUsers of non-Home editions can toggle options in menus to put off updates for months at the very least. However, Home users have to engage in hacky workarounds, such as setting their connection to 'Metered', which can have unwanted side effects due to Windows no longer downloading most Windows updates or Windows Store app updates.\n\nMicrosoft should just relent and give the Home edition the same level of control over updates as is available to Pro users.\n\n3. Allow users to opt out of feature updates altogether\n\nNot everyone appreciates Microsoft's twice-yearly feature updates messing with their desktop, and, for some, the smattering of new features are, at best, unnecessary.\n\nMicrosoft should give all users the option to completely opt out of feature updates-the most recent being the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update- and instead only receive essential patches and fixes.\n\nAs it is, users of Pro and Enterprise can defer feature updates for more than a year, so why not go one step further and let everyone opt out altogether.\n\nDoes it really make sense for people who don't have the slightest interest in virtual reality to suddenly find their computer has a Mixed Reality Portal?\n\nThere's even already precedent for the change, with Microsoft recently revealing that PCs with unsupported Intel Atom CPUs would not receive any feature updates post last summer's Anniversary Update.\n\n4. Stop trying to force Bing and the Edge browser on users\n\nWhile makes sense for Microsoft to build an ecosystem of linked services, from both a practical and commercial point of view, it would be nice if Microsoft let users choose their sniearch engine when using Windows built-in search feature.\n\nMicrosoft says that locking the Search function to Bing and its Edge browser is necessary to ensure the best possible experience for Windows 10 users.\n\nBut given the relatively limited market share of Bing and Edge, it's clear that many users prefer competing products and services, so again it would be good if Microsoft would allow users to use their search engine or browser of choice.\n\n5. Stop pushing the Microsoft Store so hard until it's better stocked\n\nMicrosoft is determined to get more people to use the Microsoft Store, whether by locking Windows 10 S to using Store apps, or by releasing Store exclusives.\n\nHowever, despite launching in 2012, the Store's selection of apps is still fairly lacklustre, especially compared to the unfettered selection of software available for the Window desktop.\n\nMicrosoft faces a classic chicken and egg problem: without the userbase, it won't get the apps, but without the apps, you can't attract the userbase.\n\nTrying to forcibly create an audience by creating an OS locked to the store isn't the answer, however, all it does is highlight just how sparse the offerings in the Microsoft Store are.\n\nBe your company's Microsoft insider with the help of these Windows and Office tutorials and our experts' analyses of Microsoft's enterprise products.

Doing things as simple as double-tapping the Home button to show the App Switcher, using Reachability for items at the top of the screen, and Force Quitting apps has changed.\n\nThese are the top five gestures that you need to know to take full advantage of the iPhone X.\n\nSEE: Mobile device computing policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\n1: How to access the App Switcher on the iPhone X\n\nOn previous versions of iOS hardware, accessing the App Switcher to swap to another app or force quit an app was as simple as double-tapping the home button; however, with iPhone X, the home button is no more.\n\nTo access the App Switcher-whether you're in an app or on the Home Screen-you'll use the Home gesture (swipe up from the bottom), except you'll stop halfway up the screen and pause. The view will change to the App Switcher you know and love (Figure A).\n\n2. How to force quit apps on the iPhone X\n\nInside of the App Switcher, you may be wondering how to force quit an app, because in this new switcher, swiping up does not quit the app. To force quit an app, launch the App Switcher, then tap and hold on an app. This will enter editing mode where you can either choose the \"-\" button that appears in the corner of each open app, or swipe up as you would on a non-iPhone X iOS device.\n\nAs we've mentioned in a previous article, you only need to Force Quit unresponsive apps. There is no need to force quit apps on a regular basis.\n\n3. How to quickly swipe to the previously used app on the iPhone X\n\nThe Home Indicator at the bottom of the screen gives you many capabilities at a single tap or swipe. Swiping from left to right on the Home Indicator will launch the previously used app from the App Switcher without the need to open the App Switcher. This feature is very useful on the iPhone and greatly improves multitasking capabilities because it lets you jump between apps quickly and efficiently.\n\nSEE: Cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)\n\n4. How to enable Reachability on the iPhone X\n\nReachability is an accessibility feature that can be enabled on previous iPhone models by double-tapping on the Home Button to slide the top of the screen down by half the screen to make top items more reachable while holding the device with one hand. With the Home Button gone, this feature has changed slightly and is not enabled by default.\n\nTo enable Reachability in iOS 11.1.1, follow these steps.\n\nOpen the Settings app. Navigate to General | Accessibility. Enable the option for Reachability (Figure B).\n\nTo use Reachability once it's enabled, swipe down on the Home Indicator at the bottom of the screen. You'll see the current app slide half way down the screen, giving you easier access to reach the items at the top of the screen.\n\n5. How to manage the iPhone X's Home Screen\n\nOn an iPhone X, you may be wondering how to exit out of Home Screen arranging mode (aka jiggly mode). First, enter this mode by tapping and holding on an icon or folder on the Home Screen. The icons will begin wiggling, and you can rearrange them. To exit this mode, swipe up from the bottom like you would to exit to the Home Screen from an app. In iOS 11.1.1, a Done button appears in the top right corner of the screen in the status bar area-Tapping this button will also exit editing mode.\n\nFor more iPhone tips and tricks, subscribe to our Apple Weekly newsletter.

    "text": "Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and NASA will partner to send a supercomputer to space, the companies announced in a blog post on Monday.\n\nThe \"Spaceborne Computer\" will be sent up to the International Space Station (ISS), first by being launched on the SpaceX CRS-12 rocket, and then sent via the SpaceX Dragon Spacecraft. It will be a year-long experiment, with aims to eventually land on a mission to Mars-a trip of the same length.\n\nWhy? Advanced computing, currently done on land, could help astronauts survive in gruelling conditions by allowing for processing of information in real-time in space.\n\nThe Spaceborne Computer comes equipped with the HPE Apollo 40 class systems, the blog post stated, which includes a high-speed HPC interconnect running an open-source Linux operating system. Importantly, this system could eliminate communication latencies, which can take up to 40 minutes, and can \"make any on-the-ground exploration challenging and potentially dangerous if astronauts are met with any mission critical scenarios that they're not able to solve themselves,\" Alain Andreoli, SVP and GM of HPE's data center infrastructure group, wrote in the blog post.\n\nA computer this advanced has never run in space before, since most computing systems are not developed to survive in brutal conditions that include factors such as radiation, solar flares, micrometeoroids, unstable electrical power and irregular cooling. However, the software on this computer was developed to withstand these types of conditions, and its water-cooled enclosure for the hardware was created to help keep the system safe.\n\nThe project, Andreoli wrote, has implications beyond what it can do for a voyage to Mars. \"The Spaceborne Computer experiment will not only show us what needs to be done to advance computing in space, it will also spark discoveries for how to improve high performance computing (HPC) on Earth and potentially have a ripple effect in other areas of technology innovation,\" Andreoli wrote.\n\nSEE: How Mark Shuttleworth became the first African in space and launched a software revolution (PDF download)\n\nThe 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers:\n\nOn Monday, a blog post by HPE announced a partnership with NASA that will send a \"Spaceborne Computer\"-a supercomputer-on a year-long experiment to the ISS. The project is intended to eventually end up on a voyage to Mars-which also takes a year-with the intention of helping astronauts perform high-level computation in space, which could eliminate the current lag-time in communication between space and Earth. The project is intended to have broader implications for the kind of advanced computing that can be done in space.\n\nFind out The Next Big Thing from TechRepublic. Subscribe",

    "title": "Apple's FileVault 2 encryption program: A cheat sheet",
    "text": "Apple's FileVault encryption program was initially introduced with OS X 10.3 (Panther), and it allowed for the encryption of a user's home folder only. Beginning with OS X 10.7 (Lion), Apple redesigned the encryption scheme and released it as FileVault 2-the program offers whole-disk encryption alongside newer, stronger encryption standards. FileVault 2 has been available to each version of OS X/macOS since 10.7; the legacy FileVault is still available in earlier versions of OS X.\n\nThis comprehensive guide about Apple's FileVault 2 covers features, system requirements, and more. We will update this article if there's new information about FileVault 2.\n\nSEE: Encryption Policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nWhat is FileVault 2, and how does it encrypt data? FileVault 2 is a whole-disk encryption program that encrypts data on a Mac to prevent unauthorized access from anyone that does not have the decryption key or user's account credentials.\n\nFileVault 2 is a whole-disk encryption program that encrypts data on a Mac to prevent unauthorized access from anyone that does not have the decryption key or user's account credentials.

One con is enabling FileVault 2 can have a negative impact on I/O performance of approximately 20-30% of modern CPUs. More pros and cons are detailed in this article. What are alternatives to FileVault 2? The main competitors are VeraCrypt, BitLocker, GnuPG, LibreCrypt, and EncFS.\n\nThe main competitors are VeraCrypt, BitLocker, GnuPG, LibreCrypt, and EncFS. How can I get FileVault 2? FileVault 2 is baked in to all versions of macOS and supported versions of OS X. The encryption program is turned off by default, though it's easy to enable.\n\nWhat is FileVault 2, and how does it encrypt the startup disk on Macs?\n\nFileVault 2 is an encryption program created by Apple that provides full-disk encryption of the startup disk on a Mac computer. By utilizing the latest encryption algorithms and leveraging the power and efficiency of modern CPUs, the entire contents of the startup disk are encrypted, preventing all unauthorized access to the data stored on the disk; the only people that can access the data have the account credentials that enabled FileVault on the disk, or possess the master recovery key.\n\nBy enabling FileVault 2's whole-disk encryption, data is secured from prying eyes and all attempts to access this data (physically or over the network) will be met with prompts to authenticate or error messages stating the data cannot be accessed-even when attempting to access data backups, which FileVault 2 encrypts as well.\n\nFileVault 2, in and of itself, cannot prevent users from attacking your system or otherwise exfiltrating the encrypted data. The encryption program is not a substitute for proper physical, logical, and data security standards, but rather a part of the overall puzzle that makes up your device's security.\n\nData encryption is often seen as the last resort because, if all other security features in place are compromised, encrypted data will still be unreadable by everyone except people that have the decryption key, or those that can brute-force their way past the algorithm, which is easier said than done.\n\nSEE: All of TechRepublic's cheat sheets and smart person's guides\n\nIf the encryption standard in place is properly implemented and uses a strong, modern algorithm, and the recovery keys are not accessible or consist of a long, random key space, the attackers will have their work cut out for them. If the attackers gain access to the data sitting on the disk, they may be able to copy it, take it off your network, and even attack it directly, but they'll still be at an impasse if they cannot crack the encryption. And if the attackers cannot crack the encryption, your data will remain unreadable, and subsequently, of little to no real use or value.\n\nIs FileVault 2 available to all macOS users?\n\nUsers running OS X 10.7 (Lion) or later, all the way through the current version of macOS 10.13 (High Sierra), may enable and fully utilize the full-disk encryption capabilities of FileVault 2 on their desktop or laptop Mac computers.\n\nBy default, the feature is disabled; however, it only takes accessing the System Preferences and clicking the Turn On FileVault 2 button to enable the feature and encrypt your whole disk. Encryption may be enabled by the user or managed by the administrators for company-owned devices. Administrators have set policies via Profile Manager and/or scripts that will enable FileVault 2 during deployment and implement institutional recovery keys that the company manages in order to recover encrypted data per device, if needed.\n\nSEE: Essential reading for IT leaders: 10 books on cybersecurity (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nOnce FileVault 2 is enabled, only the user with administrative privileges that enabled FileVault 2 with their account may decrypt the drive's contents. Additionally, a master recovery key is created during the initial process; users with either of those keys may be the only ones to decrypt the volume and read the contents of the drive.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons to using FileVault 2?\n\nIt's a native Apple solution that is designed by Apple for Apple computers.\n\nFileVault 2 supports legacy hardware, even for devices that are no longer officially supported by Apple.\n\nDeployment of FileVault 2 may be locally or centrally managed by users or the IT department.\n\nWhole-disk encryption works to safeguard all data stored on disk now and in the future.\n\nBackup of encrypted data works seamlessly with Time Machine to create automated backup sets.\n\nDisks encrypted with FileVault 2 must first be unlocked by user accounts that are \"unlocked enabled\"; these are typically accounts with administrative privilege, preventing non-admin accounts from accessing the disk's contents, regardless of the ACL permissions configured.\n\nFileVault 2 uses a strong form of block-cipher chain mode, XTS, based off the AES algorithm using 128-bit blocks and a 256-bit key.\n\nLegacy FileVault (or FileVault 1) does not encrypt the whole-disk-only the contents of a user's home folder. This affects legacy hardware that do not support the features in FileVault 2.\n\nBacking up encrypted data with Time Machine can only be done when a user is logged off of the session. For on-the-fly backups, the destination path must be a Time Machine Server, which requires macOS Server to perform online backups.\n\nThe encryption passphrase used to encrypt the disk is the same as the end-user's password that enabled FileVault 2. If the password becomes compromised, the disk may be encrypted and data may be compromised.\n\nEnabling FileVault 2 can have a negative impact on I/O performance of approximately 20-30% of modern CPUs, and it noticeably worsens performance on older processor hardware.\n\nIf the passphrase or recovery key must be changed, the entire volume will need to be decrypted and have the encryption process run again with the new key.\n\nAny device with FileVault 2 enabled must be unlocked by an admin credentialed account prior to being accessed or used by a non-admin account. If the device is not unlocked, non-admin accounts will not be able to use the computer until it is first successfully unlocked.\n\nIndividual files, folders, or any other kind of data cannot be encrypted on the fly. Only data that resides on the local disk or FileVault 2-encrypted volumes may be encrypted in their entirety.\n\nWhat are some of the alternatives to FileVault 2?\n\nVeraCrypt is a free, open source disk encryption software that provides cross-platform support for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It was derived from TrueCrypt, which was a full-disk encryption application that discontinued support by its creators after a security audit revealed several vulnerabilities in the software.\n\nHaving acquired the use of TrueCrypt, VeraCrypt forked the former app and corrected the vulnerabilities, while adding some changes to strengthen the way in which the files are stored. VeraCrypt creates a virtually encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a disk that can be read by the OS. It can encrypt the entire disk, a partition, or storage devices, such as USB flash drives and provides real-time on the fly encryption, which can be hardware-accelerated for better performance. It also supports TrueCrypt's hidden volume and hidden operating system features.\n\nBitLocker is Microsoft's full-disk encryption featured in supported versions of Windows Vista and later. Using default settings, BitLocker uses AES encryption with XTS mode in conjunction with 128-bit or 256-bit keys for maximum protection, especially when leveraged with a TPM module to ensure integrity of the trusted boot path, which prevents many physical attacks and boot sector malware from compromising your data.\n\nWhen used on a computer in an Active Directory environment, BitLocker supports key escrow, which allows the Active Directory account to store a copy of the recovery key. In the event that data needs to be recovered, administrators may retrieve the key.\n\nGnuPG is based on the PGP encryption program created by Phil Zimmermann, and later bought by Symantec. Unlike Symantec's offering, GnuPG is completely free software and part of the GNU Project. The software is command-line based and offers hybrid encryption by use of symmetric-key cryptography for performance, and public-key cryptography for the ease of exchanging secure keys.\n\nWhile the lack of GUI may not be for everyone, the program's flexibility allows for signed communications, file encryption, and, with some configuration, disk encryption to protect data. Dubbed the universal crypto engine, GnuPG can run directly from the CLI, shell scripts, or from other programs, often serving as a backend for other applications.\n\nLibreCrypt is a transparent full-disk encryption program that fully supports Windows and contains partial support for Linux distributions. It is open source and has an online community of users that are committed to resolving issues and introducing new features. Often cited as the most easy to use encryption program for Windows, it can create encrypted containers as well, mounting them as removable disks in Windows Explorer for easy access.\n\nIt addition to the multitude of supported encryption and hashing standards and modes, it also supports smart cards and security tokens to authenticate users, and decrypts data at the file level, partition, or for the entire disk.\n\nEncFS is an encrypted filesystem that runs in the user-space, using the FUSE library. The FUSE library acts as an interface for filesystems in user-space that allows users to mount and use filesystems not natively supported by the host OS. FUSE/EncFS are open source releases and support Linux, BSD, Windows, Android devices, and macOS. It is also available in a number of languages, as it has been translated by community members.\n\nWith active community support on GitHub and regular updates, EncFS offers users the ability to create a filesystem that can be mounted and used to store secure data files, and then it may be unmounted to protect against offline attacks and unauthorized user access.\n\nFileVault 2 is in all versions of OS X from 10.7 through macOS 10.13-it just needs to be enabled, as the service is turned off by default to allow end users to perform the initial setup process, which allows them to create a master recovery key. This key will act as a backup in the event that they become locked out of their account and must recover data via an alternate path.\n\nUsers of OS X prior to 10.7 may use Legacy FileVault, or FileVault 1 (the initial offering of the encryption application), which only encrypts a user's home folder and not the entire disk. This must be enabled per user on that device and will still leave any data not stored within an encrypted home folder available to unauthorized access.\n\nThe good news is that as long as your Apple computer supports a recent version of OS X or the modern releases of macOS, you can upgrade your Mac's operating system at anytime to a newer version to enjoy the benefits of FileVault 2's enhanced security.\n\nFor the latest IT security news, tips, and downloads, subscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

    "title": "How Google Fiber turned 2017 into its comeback year",
    "text": "Google Fiber showed new life in 2017, after a near death experience in late 2016. The fiber internet pioneer launched in three new cities-Huntsville, AL, Louisville, KY, and San Antonio, TX-this year. It also began to heavily rely on shallow trenching, a new method of laying cables, to expedite the construction process.\n\nSEE: Photos: How Google Fiber is using 'shallow trenching' to outbuild its gigabit rivals\n\n\"We're very pleased with the response from residents in these markets-along with our other existing Google Fiber cities, where we worked hard throughout the year to bring Fiber service to even more people in many more neighborhoods,\" a Google Fiber spokesperson told TechRepublic.\n\nThe comeback happened after a construction halt and the CEO stepping down in October 2016, which left some wondering if Fiber was on its last breath.\n\nSEE: Internet and Email usage policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nBut 2017 wasn't entirely a year of redemption. In February, hundreds of Fiber employees were moved to new jobs at Google. And Gregory McCray left the role of CEO in July after only holding the position for five months.\n\nAnd internet experts still have their doubts. Chris Antlitz, a senior analyst at Technology Business Research, labelled Fiber's year as \"not very good.\" Jim Hayes, president of the Fiber Optic Association, called Google Fiber a \"very distant player\" in the fiber market.\n\nHowever, Antlitz added that, for Alphabet-the parent company of both Google and Google Fiber-that means they're just not growing as fast as they wanted to. Google Fiber has still had an impact this year, he said.\n\nFiber set a new bar for broadband by showing incumbent internet service providers (ISPs) that it is economically feasible to bring 1 gigabit internet to consumers, Antlitz said. Since Google Fiber led a connectivity renaissance in 2011 when it launched in its first city, Kansas City, KS, top telecom providers have been in an arms race to upgrade their broadband pipes to accommodate 1 gigabit, Antlitz said.\n\nGoogle Fiber's presence in the market has caused competition that has forced other fiber providers like Verizon and AT&T Fiber to offer cheaper, faster service. Adding a second provider to a market can reduce prices by around one-third, according to a study by the Fiber to the Home Council.\n\nSEE: Google Fiber 2.0 targets the city where it will stage its comeback, as AT&T Fiber prepares to go nuclear\n\nAT&T has been particularly competitive, analysts say. They've been expanding in current and prospective Google Fiber cities, including adding new neighborhoods in San Antonio months before Google Fiber arrived.\n\nIn Louisville, AT&T sued the Louisville Metro Government over its \"One Touch Make Ready\" ordinance, which allows Google to use existing poles to install its technology without permission from the telecom company that owned the poles. The lawsuit was dismissed in August, and AT&T said it wouldn't appeal the dismissal in October.\n\nA TechRepublic investigation found that AT&T has talked a big game about its buildout in Louisville, but has dragged its feet in rolling out gigabit internet to customers and has signed up very few households. It's this kind of activity that has gotten AT&T's gigabit strategy labeled \"fiber-to-the-press-release.\"\n\nIt's unclear what Google Fiber's 2018 will look like. The company's map of Fiber cities doesn't yet list an upcoming city where Fiber will be heading next. Six potential cities-Portland, OR, San Jose, CA, Los Angeles, CA, Dallas, TX, Oklahoma City, OK, Tampa, FL, Jacksonville, FL, Phoenix, AZ-are listed as places the company is exploring.\n\nSEE: Louisville and the Future of the Smart City (a ZDNet/TechRepublic special report)\n\nWilliam Hahn, an analyst at Gartner, said going to even one-third of those cities next year would be impressive for Google Fiber. However, he said he doesn't foresee a shift in the market in the next two years. The next big gamechanger? The rollout of 5G, which will give providers more wireless to potentially play with in cities and hard-to-reach rural areas. In five US cities in 2018, Verizon plans to roll out 5G fixed wireless, which will compete directly with fiber in speed and low latency.\n\nAntlitz said it's probable that Fiber will collaborate with incumbent ISPs to target unserved and underserved communities, including those in emerging markets and harder-to-reach rural spots.\n\n\"I think they don't want to be an ISP,\" Antlitz said. \"They're trying to prove a point.\"\n\nThe point? That faster, 1 gigabit internet can be affordable-and that the existing ISPs just needed a push.\n\n\"They got what they wanted,\" Antlitz added.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Next Big Thing newsletter.

    "text": "Spend more than an hour in a meeting with any major software company and you're bound to hear the buzzword \"hyperconverged infrastructure,\" but what is it, and why should you care? Industry analyst Zeus Kerravala explained it for us in a question-and-answer session. We played the role of skeptic.\n\nSEE: Virtualization policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nTechRepublic: We think we understand what hyperconverged infrastructure means, but how would you explain it?\n\nZeus Kerravala: \"It's kind of a weird term. There was already a converged infrastructure market [lacking the software aspect] when this technology came around. Hyperconverged platforms are turnkey products that include all the hardware and software one needs to run a contained little data center in a box. ... When you look at running data center infrastructure there's a lot of different choices for buyers. If you use Cisco networking, EMC storage, and Dell computing, which is a pretty standard thing, there's over 800 configurations. [In HCI] the vendor's done all the heavy lifting. They're not plug-and-play... it's data center technology, nothing's ever going to be plug-and-play. But customers have told me the deployment time for these is days vs. months if you're trying to cobble it all together yourself.\"\n\nSEE: The cloud v. data center decision (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)\n\nTechRepublic: Do you think most corporate sysadmins and CIOs understand this?\n\nZeus Kerravala: \"I'm not sure the CIO does. I think technology has been somewhat niche. It's been used primarily for virtual desktop deployments. Those are workloads that tend to be demanding... unified communications are a likely next thing. I don't really understand where the 'hyper' came from, to be honest with you.\"\n\nTechRepublic: Most good ideas in information technology are cyclical. How much of this is truly novel and how much is just a new name?\n\nZeus Kerravala: \"We used to have converged platforms a long time ago, and we called them mainframes. The reason the hyperconverged market exists is to simplify the deployment of all the stuff we need to run data centers.\"\n\nTechRepublic: Why is this happening now?\n\nZeus Kerravala: \"I talk to CIOs. More and more, CIOs are less concerned about the technical aspects of running stuff. They want stuff to work so they can run the business. There's a theme of digital transformation that's cutting across all businesses. If you talk to a CEO about running a business, it's about speed today. It's Darwinism.\"\n\nSEE: Digital transformation: A CXO's guide (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)\n\nTechRepublic: What are the risks of changing from traditional to hyperconverged infrastructure?\n\nZeus Kerravala: \"I haven't really talked to anyone who hasn't had a good experience [except] using the technology for the wrong workloads. If you're going to run hyperconverged infrastructure, the development has to be done on a product that's at least similar from a hardware perspective.\"\n\nTechRepublic: What about hardware upgrades?\n\nZeus Kerravala: \"Applications that have the most demanding hardware requirements, I'd probably keep those on a platform that I have a little bit of control over, and I can upgrade the processors when I need to. If you wouldn't run it on a virtual machine, then certainly don't run it on this.\"\n\nTechRepublic: Which companies are offering hyperconverged infrastructure the right way?\n\nZeus Kerravala: \"The market leader right now in terms of brand and share is still Nutanix. They've done a lot of work in software. The one to watch is Dell/EMC but for specific use cases [such as with VMware's vSphere]. If your hypervisor is Microsoft or Citrix, then I might look at a different platform... 8kpc is a startup. They've done a lot of work on the hardware optimization phase.\"\n\nTechRepublic: Which companies aren't doing so well at it?\n\nZeus Kerravala: \"I think HPE is bit of a confused company right now... Lenovo is another one that I've expected more of by now.\"\n\nTechRepublic: What is your advice for customers considering a hyperconverged infrastructure product?\n\nZeus Kerravala: \"There's a lot of products on the market and they all kind of pitch the same message. But the performance from box to box, from vendor to vendor, is going to be quite different depending on what you're running on it. Do your own testing. How does it work in a hybrid cloud situation? I'd also want to know from a roadmap perspective about flash storage, 100Gb Ethernet, and then NVMe.\"\n\nTechRepublic: What else should people know?\n\nZeus Kerravala: \"Try to have a good understanding of what it means to the operational team.

    "title": "How to choose the right wearable device for business vs. fitness",
    "text": "Building a slide deck, pitch, or presentation? Here are the big takeaways:\n\nBusiness professionals could gain from wearing a wearable device, but some have more fitness features than business features.\n\nProfessionals should look for wearables with different ways to stay connected, basic activity tracking, and a fashion-forward look.\n\nWearables, like smartwatches and fitness trackers, are popular with business professionals, and for good reason. The devices can collect data and provide insights, allowing wearers to track their fitness and productivity to reach their goals faster.\n\nBut some devices may not work the best for business professionals. They may not have enough ways to stay connected in terms of communications, or they may be too focused on physical goals like meditation. And some may stand out too much for professionals in formal business attire to feel comfortable wearing them.\n\nSEE: Wearable Device Policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nConnectivity is the first thing to consider when selecting a wearable for business purposes. Some options can connect to a smartphone, while others work outside of a cellular network. Some professionals need constant access to business communication, and selecting a wearable that works in tandem with a smartphone can provide that.\n\nThink about what you want to accomplish with your wearable. Do you want to just be able to see notifications, or do you need to be able to answer texts and emails as well? What about activity tracking? It can help you understand how you spend your hours to find ways to become more productive, or you can use it for fitness purposes as well.\n\nApps and integrations can be helpful for business professionals, so check out what is available. Some, especially ones connected to a smartphone, have multiple options, while others have fewer choices. Integrations can streamline things between your wearable and other devices, potentially making you more efficient. Apps can offer new ways to boost productivity.\n\nMindfulness features are also helpful, especially in high-stress jobs or industries. A sleep tracker can help understand if you're sleeping long or well enough.\n\nFinally, looks aren't everything, but some wearables can stand out when worn with business attire. More wearables are adopting the look of traditional watches, with leather bands and sleek faces. A wearable won't do much if you don't wear it because of its look.\n\nFirst, you should consider if you want one device to carry from work to the gym, or if you want separate options. Some popular devices, like the Apple Watch, can work for both environments due to the amount of features and connectivity options.\n\nMuch like with business wearables, you need to consider what exactly the fitness tracker needs to do. Most will offer the same baseline metrics, but others offer more analytics. How much insight do you want into your workouts? Some only need simple step tracking, but someone training for a marathon may need more detail.\n\nIn what physical environment are you going to use the device? Whatever the answer, the tracker should be ready. For example, if you're a swimmer, you obviously need a water-resistant device. Runners may want a device with a built-in GPS so they can track their runs.\n\nYou should also consider the tracker's connected app, if it has one. What analysis and insights can you get on the app? Does it have features to track food and water intake? Like with business wearables, integrations may also be important, so review the offerings.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Tech News You Can Use newsletter. Subscribe",

    "title": "How to sort and delete sets of Gmail messages: 4 steps",
    "text": "You might want to mass delete email from Gmail for many reasons: To remove non-work-related messages from an account, to achieve \"inbox zero\" as part of a personal productivity effort, or-more mundanely-to reduce the storage space used by attachments. Some people pursue #NoEmail-and start to treat email as an ephemeral communication channel instead of a permanent archive.\n\nBefore you start to mass delete items from Gmail, I recommend that you export your current email data. To do this, use Google Takeout at Choose the \"Select None\" button, then scroll down the page to Mail. Move the slider to the right of Mail to \"on.\" (You may export just some of your email: Select the down arrow to the left of the slider, then choose one-or more-Gmail labels to select items tagged with those labels to export.)\n\nSelect Next at the bottom of the page, then choose the format, file sizes, and storage action for your export. Wait to start your deletions until you've either downloaded or verified that your exported email has been stored. (Note: If you use G Suite, an administrator has the ability to disable access to Takeout. If that's the case, talk with your administrator about backup before you begin.)\n\nAfter you backup, cycle through the following four steps to move sets of email to the Gmail trash.\n\nI've found that typing search terms into the Gmail search box in the desktop Chrome browser to be the most efficient way to find and select sets of emails. And while Google gives you a long list of search operators, I suggest you start with the following:\n\nEmail address . Enter to: or from: followed by an email address to find all of the email sent to or received from an address.\n\n. Enter to: or from: followed by an email address to find all of the email sent to or received from an address. Subject . Enter subject: followed by a word (or a phrase in quotes) to find all email that contains the word or phrase specified.\n\n. Enter subject: followed by a word (or a phrase in quotes) to find all email that contains the word or phrase specified. Date . While there are several time-search options, try before: or older_than: first. The first locates items prior to a specified data, while the latter locates item older than a certain number of days, months, or years (e.g., 3d, 1m, or 7y for 3 days, 1 month, or 7 years, respectively) from the current date.\n\n. While there are several time-search options, try before: or older_than: first. The first locates items prior to a specified data, while the latter locates item older than a certain number of days, months, or years (e.g., 3d, 1m, or 7y for 3 days, 1 month, or 7 years, respectively) from the current date. Size. Locates email larger than a specific size. For example, larger:20M finds items larger than 20Mb.\n\nOften a simple search may be all you need to locate a set of email you no longer need. For example, you might not need to keep receipts from some vendors (email address), accepted calendar invitations (subject), email older than 3 years (date), or large files (size) stored elsewhere.\n\nReview the search results to see if you wish to keep email found with a simple search. If no, move on to step no. 3.\n\nIf you see emails that you wish to keep among the results, you'll need to refine your search. You can combine multiple search terms. For example, search for both an email address and a date:\n\nThis would find items older than one year from the current day. Or, add a subject as well, to narrow the results further:\n\nYou may use the - character to exclude a search term (or terms). For example:\n\nolder_than:1y -subject:\"Quarterly review\"\n\nThis would find items older than a year sent to a specific email address, but would exclude any emails with the subject \"Quarterly review.\"\n\nIf more than one screen of results is indicated, select the arrow in the upper right area to review additional screens of email search results.\n\nRefine and review the results until you're confident that all the email found by your search is email you wish to delete.\n\nSelect the box at the top of the column above your email search results to select all of the email displayed.\n\nIf your search returns more email than is displayed on the current screen, you'll see a message above the list of email that gives you the option to \"Select all conversations that match this search.\" Click the words to select all conversations that match your search terms.\n\nSelect the trashcan icon to delete the selected email.\n\nRepeat your search to find, select, and delete as many sets of email as you wish. When I help people get control of their email we often search for things such as:\n\nOld promotional emails, newsletters, and updates\n\nEmail no longer needed from specific clients, vendors, or colleagues\n\nSystem status notices (e.g., update notifications and system down/up notifications)\n\nOutdated social media or account sign-in notifications\n\nEmail related to prior jobs (including paid and volunteer roles)\n\nTip: Use a label to exclude a set from a search\n\nOften, I find it helpful to label a set of email so that I can always exclude that set of email when I work through the email deletion process. For example, you might want to keep all email from a specific person (or several people).\n\nTo do this, first create a Gmail label, such as \"Never delete.\" Then, search for a colleague's email address. Select all email with that person, then select the label icon, choose the label you created (e.g., \"Never delete\"), then select \"Apply\" at the bottom of the column. Repeat this process for as many criteria as you wish\n\nThen, when you do searches, always exclude labels that match the selected set. For example:\n\nThis would return all emails older than a year, while excluding all emails labeled \"Never delete.\"\n\nAt this point, you're done. Gmail will remove items left in the trash after 30 days. If you really want things deleted now, you can always navigate to the trash, select all items (and select all items in the trash), then choose \"Delete forever.\"\n\nA G Suite administrator has at least two significant options available to manage mail, as well. First, an administrator can set a Gmail auto-delete policy (from admin.google.com, sign-in, then Apps > G Suite > Gmail > Advanced settings > Compliance: Email and chat auto-deletion) for messages to either be moved to trash or deleted after a specified number of days.\n\nThe administrator also may specify that emails with a specific label (or labels) will not be auto-deleted. Second, a G Suite administrator can configure Google Vault, which gives the organization a sophisticated set of controls to preserve, search, and export email communications for legal and/or compliance purposes. (Vault is included with Business and Enterprise edition licenses.)\n\nDo you maintain a pristine, close-to-zero Gmail inbox? Or do you archive everything forever? How often do you delete sets of messages from Gmail? Let me know in the comments - or on Twitter\n\nSubscribe now to our Google Weekly newsletter to stay informed of useful Google news and tips!

    "title": "Google Cloud Speech API gets enterprise upgrade with new tools and 30 more languages",
    "text": "On Monday, Google announced new updates to its Cloud Speech API that could help make it a more effective tool for business users. According to a Google blog post, the API is getting a new feature called word-level timestamps, along with support for 30 new languages and three hour files.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, the Google Cloud Speech API uses neural network models to allow developers to convert audio to text. It's powered by machine learning, and can return its results in real-time.\n\nWord-level timestamps, the post said, was the most requested feature for the API from developers. Essentially, this feature adds a timestamp for each word it identifies in a given transcription. \"Word-level timestamps let users jump to the moment in the audio where the text was spoken, or display the relevant text while the audio is playing,\" the post said.\n\nSEE: How we learned to talk to computers, and how they learned to answer back (PDF download)\n\nOne of the customers cited in the post, Happy Scribe, uses the word-level timestamps to lower the time it takes for them to proofread the transcriptions they offer their customers. Another firm, VoxImplant, uses it to better analyze recorded phone conversations between two parties.\n\nAs part of a broader announcement around Google's voice input capabilities, the Cloud Speech API will now offer support for 30 additional languages, bringing the total number supported up to 119. The languages will first be offered to Cloud Speech API customers, but will eventually be supported on other Google products, like Gboard, as well.\n\nAs noted by ZDnet's Stephanie Condon, the extended language support could help Google win over some customers in emerging markets.\n\nThe full list of languages that work with the Cloud Speech API can be found here.\n\nAdditionally, the post said, the Cloud Speech API will now support files that are longer than three hours in duration, an increase from the previous limit of 80 minutes. Files that are longer than three hours can be supported on a \"case-by-case basis by applying for a quota extension through Cloud Support.\"\n\nThe 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers\n\nGoogle Cloud Speech API now supports 119 languages and three hour long files, and offers a new word-level timestamp feature. Word-level timestamps were the no. 1 most-requested feature, allowing developers to jump to the moment where a certain word was said in an audio transcript. The features could help make the API more business-friendly, and the language support could win Google some business in emerging markets.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Google Weekly newsletter.

    "title": "How Australia's backdoor proposal could threaten security for the rest of the world",
    "text": "Should world governments have backdoors to encrypted applications?\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull recently made a proposal to ensure that law enforcement can still gain access to information despite its' protection by encryption. Access Now's US Policy Manager Amie Stepanovich met with TechRepublic's Dan Patterson to explain why that may be a bad idea.\n\n\"The problem with [this proposal] is that by allowing that law enforcement access, what you're doing is you're creating a security technology that fails sometimes,\" Stepanovich said.\n\nSee: IT security and privacy: Concerns, initiatives, and predictions (Tech Pro Research)\n\nEncryption is the first defense against people trying to compromise your personal data. Since encryption isn't a failproof technology, building it in can lead to more data breaches and crime because it's facilitating a much less secure internet, she said.\n\nThe policy requested by Turnbull affects the rest of the world because Australia's encryption policy could set a precedent for other countries. Stepanovich noted that it's important to understand that this policy would likely not stop criminals or terrorists from accessing secure communications technologies. The math used in encrypted applications, she said, is not subject to the whims of politicians, which means bad actors will still be able to cover their tracks.\n\nSee: Encryption Policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nIn the past, other governments have pursued similar policies. For example, some require keys to be stored in third-party facilities and are easily stolen. Some countries restrict the strength of encryption or even prevent the use of end-to-end encryption. These tactics are easily circumvented, said Stepanovich.\n\nShe reiterated the need for privacy as a tool that protects consumer privacy, communication between journalists and sources, whistleblowers, and corporate intellectual property. \"We're at a time where we need to be facilitating research into and development of the strongest security tools possible,\" she said. \"We need to be investing in security as much as we possibly can,\" said Stepanovich.\n\nStrengthen your organization's IT security defenses by keeping abreast of the latest cybersecurity news, solutions, and best practices.

    "title": "How one AI company is bringing medical care to millions of rural Chinese residents",
    "text": "China's population, which in 2016 had 793 million urban residents and 590 rural residents, is spread out over a land mass of 3.7 million square miles.\n\nBy 2010, 93% of the rural population had healthcare coverage, but providing rural medicine and timely healthcare to rural regions persist. This is where analytics can make a difference.\n\n\"We wanted to take analytics, artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies and use them to better understand different medical conditions, how to diagnose them, and how to treat them,\" said Kuan Chen, founder and CEO of Infervision, a Chinese artificial intelligence and deep learning company that specializes in medical image diagnosis.\n\nAnalytics, artificial intelligence, and deep learning are put into play by analyzing medical images and reports on different pathological conditions, and then coming up with different models and sources of treatment and medical interventions based on common patterns that are assembled from studies of thousands of patients in China's urban hospitals. \"These models use deep learning to 'learn' from the data and continuously improve their diagnostic capabilities,\" said Chen.\n\nThe first disease that Chen targeted was lung cancer, with the software being able to locate hard-to-detect or hidden nodules in the lungs that could prove to be cancerous.\n\nNow the task at hand is providing a similar diagnostic and medical intervention tool for strokes, which can especially be useful in rural areas where qualified medical practitioners are scarce.\n\nSEE: IT leader's guide to deep learning (Tech Pro Research)\n\n\"By studying the stroke condition of a patient, the analytics can determine what is the optimum time table for treatment, and how aggressively the stroke should be treated,\" said Chen. In short, the AI and analytics become a second pair of eyes for radiologists against which they can cross-check their own diagnoses.\n\n\"In many rural areas in China, there are no trained radiologists who can help stroke victims,\" said Chen. \"And in other areas of the world, like the US, radiologists make an average of $375,000 a year, so they are very expensive.\"\n\nChen says that the feedback he gets from hospitals is that younger radiologists and medical practitioners rely heavily on AI, while older practitioners prefer to use it as a second opinion that they cross-check against their own.\n\n\"In a stroke, you want to respond to the condition as quickly as possible,\" said Chen. \"It might take 30 to 35 seconds in a standard process to generate a report on the condition so treatment can be determined. With our tool, that time is cut to less than three seconds.\"\n\nThe use of deep learning and expanded analytics also expand the spectrum of diagnosis, which can lead to better results.\n\n\"In one non-stroke case that involved diagnosis and treatment of a bone fracture and a degenerated area of bone, the standard approach is to treat the affected area itself,\" said Chen. \"With analytics and AI, a system can focus on different areas of the body that are far removed from where the problem is to see if these other areas could be affecting the condition. If it is a problem that is being generated far from the fracture itself, the analytics allow us to treat causes of the condition, and not just symptoms.\"\n\nSEE: How to implement AI and machine learning (free PDF) (ZDNet/TechRepublic special report)\n\nHere are some best practices hospitals and clinics can adopt as AI and deep learning tools evolve:\n\nDeploy the tool where help is needed most\n\nIf there is an acute shortage of medical practitioners in a specific region, analytics and AI can help in situations like stroke intervention and treatment, and the chances for success for patients will improve.\n\nRadiologists and medical practitioners must develop knowledge and experience before they can become expert diagnosticians. An analytics and deep learning tool can assist in the training process because users can compare their own findings against what the system finds in numerous scenarios.\n\nYou might think you are going to treat one condition and end up treating another. The bone fracture that Chen mentioned, where the system actually found the causal problem in a different area of the body, is a prime example. This is why medical practitioners should keep their minds open.\n\nNever forget that AI and deep learning tools are still developing\n\nJust because a system uses AI, deep learning and analytics doesn't mean that is it always right. Medical practitioners should use these systems as assistants and not as undisputed authorities, because there are some areas where a machine can't be a replacement for human thought and reasoning.\n\nFor more about AI, big data, and the latest innovations, subscribe to our Next Big Thing newsletter.

    "title": "A new slim version of Windows 10 called \"Lean\" could be perfect for low-end PCs",
    "text": "Building a slide deck, pitch, or presentation? Here are the big takeaways:\n\nA new stripped-down Windows 10 build called \"Lean\" was discovered in the latest Insider preview of Windows 10. It lacks many Windows 10 features and has a 2GB smaller installation size.\n\nMicrosoft hasn't said what Lean's purpose is, but it appears to be for lower-end machines or those that need to be locked down from user tampering.\n\nMicrosoft's latest Windows Insider skip ahead build contains a new version of Windows 10 called Windows 10 Lean, which cuts the installation size by 2 GB.\n\nDiscovered by Twitter user Lucan, Windows 10 Lean cuts out several Windows 10 features: desktop wallpaper is disabled by default, the Microsoft Management Console and registry editor are missing, drivers for CD and DVD drives can't be installed, Microsoft Edge doesn't allow downloads, and Microsoft Office is missing as well.\n\nAt first glance it may seem that Windows 10 Lean is an alternative to Windows 10 S (which only allows app installation from the Windows Store), but Lucan quickly dismissed that by saying that those restrictions don't apply, as he was able to run applications normally locked to Windows 10 S users.\n\nThe Twitter discussion growing up around Lucan's discovery of Windows 10 Lean is devoid of one important thing: an explanation as to its purpose.\n\nMary Jo Foley from TechRepublic sister site ZDNet speculated that it was a version of Windows 10 S for home or enterprise, but Lucan said he doesn't think that's the case. Windows 10 S, he said, is more like a set of restrictions on top of a standard Windows 10 install, which Lean definitely isn't.\n\nAnother Twitter commenter said it may be ideal for educational use, as schools often have older computers that need a smaller install. Add to that the heavy restrictions on what a user can do in Windows 10 Lean (no downloading, no Regedit, etc.) and you have a relatively resilient OS that has lower-end hardware requirements.\n\nSEE: Securing Windows policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nWIndows 10 Lean could make a great OS for any systems that see a lot of user contact: Loaner machines, kiosks, sales floor demos, and other specific roles would be a great fit for Lean.\n\nAnyone who has ever managed computers that see a lot of public contact knows they have to be locked down, and Windows 10 Lean seems designed for that particular purpose. There are a lot of things users can't do in a base install of Lean, leaving it up to an administrator to pre-load an installation with certain software or settings that would be largely unalterable.\n\nGiven the limits of WIndows 10 Lean it's likely that it's designed to save space, be a quick install, and be customized as an image prior to being installed. Lean images could be configured to suit specific roles, and users would be largely unable to damage them.\n\nWe won't know what Windows 10 Lean is really designed for until Microsoft says so, but If you want to check it out now you can do so in Redstone 5 Insider preview build 17650, available now to Windows Insider members.\n\nGet a roundup of the biggest Microsoft news of the week in your inbox: Subscribe to our Microsoft Weekly newsletter.

    "title": "Essential Phone PH-1 review: The many positives, plus a few drawbacks",
    "text": "Before I made the purchase of an Essential Phone, like everyone else, I scoured through review after review. My goal was to sift through the chaff and find something that would key me into understanding what was at the core of the PH-1. It didn't take long for a common thread to bubble up from the surface. That thread? A less-than stellar camera. The good news for me was that I don't consider a smartphone's primary function to be taking photos, so having the best camera available wasn't a top priority.\n\nWith that out of the way, it seemed the PH-1 met all of my needs, and did so at a price point that was right on the money. And thus, I made the purchase, and set aside my OnePlus 3 to embark on a journey with the newest underdog.\n\nAs many of you know, I'm a big fan of the underdog. I've been using Linux as my primary OS for decades, so I'm accustomed to watching a platform scrape and dig for attention and respect. However, after just two weeks of use, I'm convinced the PH-1 shouldn't be considered an underdog but a top dog, in a class by itself.\n\nThat's not to say it's perfect because it's not, but no device is (and anyone who believes otherwise is kidding themselves).\n\nNow that I've had plenty of time to experience Essential's first foray into the smartphone market, I feel like I have plenty to say about the device. And, with that said, let's dive into the good and the bad.\n\nSEE: Mobile device computing policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nI thought I'd flip the script and start with the bad. Why? Because there isn't much in the way of bad to be found. In fact, I have to trick myself into thinking \"Maybe photos are more important than I originally thought!\" before I can really come up with something negative of note to say about the PH-1.\n\nIt has been well documented that the Essential Phone's camera is lackluster. The software is a bit slow, and the low-light photos are far from great. The selfie camera also suffers from the software issues that hinder the main camera.\n\nHowever, after four updates (that's right, four updates since I received the device, more on that in a bit), I've watched the camera app improve exponentially. It's still not nearly as good as the Pixel 2 camera app for instance, but it's passible. For anyone that doesn't consider photos to be a priority, the camera app will suffice.\n\nThe only other nit to pick is that the gorgeous case is the biggest fingerprint magnet I've ever seen. I'm constantly wiping the back down. Had this phone not been nearly as beautiful as it is, the fingerprints wouldn't concern me. But the PH-1 is one of the most elegant smartphones I have ever held in my hand, so my propensity is to keep it clean. Essential should be cleaning up in awards for hardware design-of that there is no doubt.\n\nFinally, there is no headphone jack. That's okay for two reasons: Bluetooth headphones have come a very long way, and Essential included the necessary dongle so users won't have to toss their standard headphones or other devices that might make use of that common interface.\n\nThere is almost too much to say here , so I'm going to boil it down to a few \"essential\" items.\n\nFirst and foremost: the design. As I said, it's gorgeous. But even the titanium sides and ceramic back take a seat to the display. No it's not the most cutting edge (Essential went with an LCD display, instead of the more popular, flagship level, OLED option), but the edge to edge is absolutely beautiful. Essential essentially proved that a bezel-less device is very much possible and their home screen launcher makes perfect use of the screen real estate (Figure A).\n\nThe one downfall is that not every app found in the Google Play Store makes use of that full screen. To Essential's credit, so far I've only found one app that didn't-Discogs (Figure B).\n\nBeyond the hardware, there's the stock Android (shipping with Android 7.1.1). If you're looking for nothing but essential Android, the PH-1 delivers. Upon arrival the device included the bare minimum software. There was zero bloat. Couple that with the speedy Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, and that barebones Android runs as smoothly as any flagship device. Period. Apps install quickly, start instantly, and run smoothly. The PH-1 easily stands toe-to-toe with my wife's Samsung Galaxy S8.\n\nOne very crucial aspect many users will appreciate is how quickly the PH-1 receives the Android Security Patch. Since initially turning on the device, my PH-1 has received four Android updates. Even though the device is running Android 7.1.1, it enjoys the most recent Security Patch (Figure C).\n\nThe combination of beautiful and powerful hardware, and up-to-date barebones software make for an incredible experience.\n\nIf you're tired of devices shipping with bloat-and who isn't-the PH-1 might be the ideal device for you.\n\nIf you're constantly on-the-go, the titanium case is strong enough to withstand your brutal abuse.\n\nIf you're a fan of the underdog, the PH-1 is the perfect smartphone for you. The ratio of price to performance will absolutely blow you away. No other smartphone, regardless of manufacturer, enjoys this level of form and function. Essential has every right to stand with the leaders in the industry. It's every bit as cool as the iPhone X and as flexible as any Android device-all without the price found with most flagship smartphones.\n\nIf you like your devices to turn heads, the PH-1 is the perfect mix of brawn, brains, and beauty. The look of the PH-1 draws onlookers in, and the performance locks them in. The second you hold the PH-1 in your hand you'll know you've purchased a quality product. This is a flagship smartphone, there's no doubt.\n\nBravo Essential, you've created something special.\n\nAutomatically sign up for TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise Newsletter for more news and tips.

Uber has since temporarily stopped its self-driving operations in Tempe and all other cities where it has been testing its vehicles, including Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and Toronto.\n\nThe vehicle was in autonomous mode at the time of the accident, with a vehicle operator behind the wheel, according to a statement from the Tempe police.\n\nMore about autonomous vehicles Special report: Tech and the future of transportation (free PDF) This ebook, based on the latest special feature from ZDNet and TechRepublic, looks at emerging autonomous transport technologies and how they will affect society and the future of business.

However, autonomous vehicles have been involved in a number of other accidents, including backing into a delivery truck in Las Vegas and getting hit by another car whose human driver did not yield in Tempe, both in 2017.\n\nIn May 2016, a Tesla driver was killed in an accident while the car was operating in its semi-autonomous Autopilot mode. A US Department of Transportation investigation did not identify any defects in design or performance of the Autopilot system.\n\nThe pedestrian fatality could have immediate implications for the rollout of self-driving taxis and delivery vehicles, which are predicted by many to be the first widespread applications of self-driving technology. It could mean that progress is slowed until more regulations are in place.\n\nThe accident could also impact discussions around how autonomous vehicles will change auto insurance. KPMG estimates that the technology will lead to an 80% drop in accident frequency by 2040, and that providers will need to shift from covering the car itself to the software of the car. It remains to be seen how coverage of accidents like this may change.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Tech News You Can Use newsletter. Subscribe",

    "title": "IBM Watson Data Kits speed enterprise AI development",
    "text": "Building a slide deck, pitch, or presentation? Here are the big takeaways:\n\nIBM launched IBM Watson Data Kits, designed to speed the development of AI applications in the enterprise.\n\nEnterprise AI apps created with IBM Watson Data Kits have the potential to aid in faster, more informed decision making for business leaders.\n\nOn Tuesday, IBM launched IBM Watson Data Kits, designed to speed the development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the enterprise. These apps have the potential to aid in faster, more informed decision making for business leaders, according to a press release.\n\n\"Watson Data Kits will provide companies across industries with pre-enriched, machine readable, industry-specific data that can enable them to scale AI across their business,\" the release said.\n\nIn Q2, Watson Data Kits will become available for the travel, transportation, and food industries, with kits for travel points of interest and food menus. Kits tailored for additional industries are also expected in the coming months, the release noted.\n\nSEE: The Power of IoT and Big Data (Tech Pro Research)\n\nMore than half of data scientists said they spend most of their time on janitorial tasks, such as cleaning and organizing data, labeling data, and collecting data sets, according to a CrowdFlower report, making it difficult for business leaders to implement AI technology at scale. Streamlining and accelerating the development process for AI engineers and data scientists will help companies more quickly gain insights from their data, and drive greater business value, according to IBM.\n\n\"Big data is fueling the cognitive era. However, businesses need the right data to truly drive innovation,\" Kristen Lauria, general manager of Watson media and content, said in the release. \"IBM Watson Data Kits can help bridge that gap by providing the machine-readable, pre-trained data companies require to accelerate AI development and lead to a faster time to insight and value. Data is hard, but Watson can make it easier for stakeholders at every level, from CIOs to data scientists.\"\n\nThe Watson Data Kit for travel points of interest will offer airlines, hotels, and online travel agencies with more than 300,000 points of interest in 100 categories, to create better experiences for travelers, according to the release. Companies in the travel and transportation industry can use the kits to build AI-powered web and mobile apps to help users find information on points of interest in a given area. For example, the release noted, a hospitality company could use the data kit to train AI powering its chatbot to recommend personalized destinations based on a customer's individual preferences.\n\nMeanwhile, the Watson Data Kit for food menus includes 700,000 menus in 21,000 US cities, according to the release. This will offer AI developers content for apps that can help users filter menu items, types of food, locations, and price points. The kit allows developers to build in side-by-side comparisons of menu choices and prices. For example, the release noted, the kit could be integrated into a car's navigation system to provide voice-activated directions to the closest bakery that sells gluten-free muffins.\n\nStay up to date on all the latest big data news.

    "title": "How the NFL and Amazon unleashed 'Next Gen Stats' to grok football games",
    "text": "The National Football League has 180 million fans worldwide. About 17 million of those trek out to stadiums each season-which means over 90% of NFL fans are catching the games on TV, online and mobile. That's why NFL games represented 37 of the top 50 highest-rated television broadcasts of 2017.\n\nA lot of the appeal of football is that it's not just about the long throws of quarterbacks, the bullish strength of defensive lineman, and the lightning-fast reflexes of wide receivers, for example. It's about the chess match between the coaches, and the preparation, instincts, and quick decision-making of the smartest players.\n\nBut while these athletic feats are amazing to watch and easy to recognize, it's often a lot harder to pinpoint the strategies and the smarts that tip a game one way or the other.\n\nThat's where the NFL's Next Gen Stats-a big partnership with Amazon Web Services-is changing how the game is understood, using a combination of cloud computing, big data analytics, and machine learning.\n\n\"We've been turning a corner on creating metrics that are more advanced and do a better job of telling the story of the game,\" Matt Swensson, the NFL's vice president of emerging products and technology, told TechRepublic.\n\nSEE: Big data policy (Tech Pro Research) | Job description: Chief data officer (Tech Pro Research) | Job description: Data scientist (Tech Pro Research)\n\nThe NFL has been keeping statistics since 1920. But most of the stats that it displays to the public had been pretty standard for the past several decades. It was the kind of stuff you see on trading cards and game programs-yards passing, yards rushing, catches, tackles, quarterback sacks, interceptions, etc.\n\nBut in 2015, it began putting a pair of RFID tags from Zebra Technologies on the shoulder pads of every NFL player in order to track speed, field location, and movement patterns. Now, it also has sensors on the referees, first down markers, and end zone pylons.\n\nHow to fully take advantage of all this data and convert it into value for the NFL and its customers was the big challenge.\n\nWhen Amazon learned that the NFL now had all this player telemetry data, the AWS team suggested that they could help create more value with analytics-similar to what AWS had famously done with Major League Baseball Advanced Media.\n\n\"We started working with [the NFL] to help them apply machine learning to that data,\" AWS vice president of marketing Ariel Kelman told TechRepublic. \"They're recording things like when the ball was snapped, what the formation was, how many of which type of player was on the field, what the result of the play was. A lot of that is pattern recognition... The idea is there's a whole bunch of things that require manual detection and tagging that they want to be able to automate.\"\n\nSo AWS and the NFL drew up a partnership where the NFL used the Amazon cloud, its advanced analytics tools and the new SageMaker machine learning product-while Amazon got to slap the AWS logo on Next Gen Stats as the official sponsor and get a bunch of promotional opportunities that show off what its big data tools can do.\n\nThe deal kicked off about six months ago, before the start of the 2017 football season, and culminates on Sunday in Super Bowl LII-although both the AWS and NFL folks were even more excited about what they're going to be able to do with the data next year.\n\nHere are the three main ways it's changing the game:\n\n1. The impact of Next Gen Stats on NFL teams\n\nOne week of NFL games now creates 3TB of data, NFL CIO Michelle McKenna-Doyle said in her presentation at Amazon's re:Invent conference last November. After each game, the league now exports a trove of data to each team to help them evaluate their overall performance and their players. The league provides some basic tools to help the teams evaluate the data along with a few basic insights. Some teams have their own data scientists or analytics partners to take it further.\n\nThe teams are using the data to help inform their training, fitness, and game preparation. But there's one big caveat that's keeping them from using the data to plan game strategies and draw up plays.\n\n\"Right now clubs are getting just their side of the ball, and so that's a decision point that's coming up,\" said the NFL's Swensson. \"We want to be able to ultimately get to a place where both sides of the ball are available to clubs, so they can do a lot more interesting analysis.\"\n\nIn other words, teams don't get their opponents' in-depth data or the patterns that machine learning can see. That's a big topic for the NFL in the upcoming off-season, and it's an issue that's up for consideration by the NFL Competition Committee.\n\n2. The impact of Next Gen Stats on NFL broadcasts\n\nThe place where Next Gen Stats has made its most visible impact is on the television broadcasts of NFL games by CBS Sports (both TechRepublic and CBS Sports are owned by CBS). AWS has brought the data visualizations of Next Gen Stats into CBS broadcasts and given CBS analysts data points to explain some of the most important plays in the game. AWS is also working with the NFL's other broadcast partners to bring similar capabilities next season.\n\nSome of the Next Gen Stats that analysts now have access to include, for example:\n\nReal-time location data on all of the players\n\nTotal running distance for each player for the entire game\n\nThe amount of separation that receivers get from their defenders\n\nThe pressure rate that defenses have on quarterbacks\n\nPercentage of quarterback throws into tight windows\n\nAnnouncers such as former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo-a new color commentator at CBS this season-have embraced the data and used it to help give viewers an inside look at why some of the plays on the field succeed and others don't.\n\n\"We're working with the guys in production at CBS Sports to try and evolve it to really make the fan experience better. It's early days. What we've learned from baseball is the way to present this data,\" said Amazon's Kelman.\n\n\"We're looking forward to taking it to the next level next season.\"\n\n3. The impact of Next Gen Stats on NFL fans\n\nFor fans, the NFL has launched nextgenstats.nfl.com as a portal to view these new insights and data points. There are all kinds of new statistics that you've never seen on the back of a trading, such as:\n\nAverage Completed Air Yards (quarterbacks)\n\nAggressiveness Percentage (quarterbacks)\n\nAverage Time Behind Line of Scrimmage (running backs)\n\nThe site also includes charts for quarterbacks, running backs, and receivers to see their patterns from their last game. In addition, the NFL publishes photo essays with specific insights from Next Gen Stats from the previous week's games, as well as videos that explain the differences and similarities between players, teams, and games based on the data.\n\n\"There's some very complicated parts of football that can be really fascinating to die hard fans,\" said Swensson. \"A lot of times you watch a game and maybe you don't realize some of the decisions and why they are made, or even some of the intricacies of the game such as why players line up a certain way. My hope is that [Next Gen Stats] continues to educate fans and help them understand more and more of our game.\"\n\nSEE: Turning Big Data into Business Insights (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)\n\nThis stuff is obviously great source material for fantasy football junkies, but it can also fuel die-hard fans in their search to better understand the performance of their team and their favorite players-which can also create greater customer loyalty for the NFL. The good news for fans is that the program is just getting off the ground.\n\n\"The stuff you see on the site now is just based off the tracking data and the splits we've been able to do based on location data, but not much pattern recognition,\" said Swensson. \"A lot of the machine learning stuff we've done, we haven't put up yet. Our plan is to launch that for next season.\"\n\nOf course, there's one more big game left this season. For the fans watching Super Bowl LII between the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday, here are a pair of Next Gen Stats videos that break down what's likely to be the game's key matchup:\n\n\"The typical conversation that we're having with customers around machine learning is that it is one of the top priorities,\" said Kelman. \"But, there is a huge gap in most of these companies between what they want to do and the skills of their people. It's kind of as simple as we have all this data, what should we do with machine learning? What problems should we point it at, and what kind of predictions should we make? The more examples that we can give our customers of what other people are doing, the better.\"\n\nSubscribe to TechRepublic's Big Data newsletter to keep up with the latest tips and best practices.

    "title": "Microsoft Office users beware: New malware comes through PowerPoint email attachment",
    "text": "A new malware campaign is making its way into businesses through a malicious PowerPoint email attachment, Trend Micro research has found. According to blog post, CVE-2017-0199 traditionally utilizes RTF documents, and this is the first time it has been seen to abuse PowerPoint Slide Show in the wild.\n\nThe malware comes in an email that appears to be from a company that manufactures cables. The email tells the recipient to see the order and asks for them to quote cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) and free on board (FOB) prices as well. Due to the targeted nature of the email, as the criminals are typically going after electronics companies, the post said, the email is being considered a spear phishing attack.\n\nIn the sample email provided by Trend Micro, the attachment is titled PO-483848.ppsx. In that case, PO could be short for purchase order, in an effort to increase the perceived legitimacy of the PowerPoint file.\n\nSEE: 10 ways to minimize fileless malware infections\n\nIf the victim opens the attached file, there will be no purchase order, not even any fake text attempting to be one. It simply reads: CVE-2017-8570. That's the name of another Microsoft vulnerability, the post said, but not the one that this particular malware is targeting.\n\nPowerPoint then initializes a script moniker and runs the malicious payload, the post said. If successful, it will download an XML file from the internet. Some JavaScript code in that XML file runs a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote access tool.\n\nAt this point, the attackers will be able to run remote commands on the victim's machine. \"The tool's capabilities are quite comprehensive, and includes a download & execute command, a keylogger, a screen logger, and recorders for both webcam and microphone,\" the post said.\n\nThe biggest issue for this given attack is the fact that it comes by way of a PowerPoint file. Most current detection methods focus on the RTF delivery method, so that means attackers utilizing the PPSX files could have an easier time avoiding antivirus detection, the post said.\n\nTo protect against attacks like this one, businesses should make sure that their systems are properly patched and updated to account for any known vulnerabilities. Also, users should be regularly educated on proper security hygiene and email etiquette.\n\nThe 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers\n\nA new spear phishing campaign is using PowerPoint files to exploit the CVE-2017-0199 and deliver malware to victims. If a user clicks on the attached file, it will run a remote access tool, and could allow attackers access to a user's keystrokes, screen, webcam, and microphone. IT should keep systems update and educate users on the proper behavior regarding attachments and emails from outside parties.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

    "title": "Why Wikipedia's cofounder wants to replace the online encyclopedia with the blockchain",
    "text": "Many industries have adopted blockchain technology as a core part of their operations. It creates transparency and trust between parties so that trust is no longer needed, which is why industries such as real estate, finance, and advertising are beginning to use it. And now, Wikipedia's cofounder Larry Sanger wants blockchain to replace the free online encyclopedia.\n\nTechRepublic's Dan Patterson met with Sanger to discuss why he joined Everipedia, and why the blockchain should replace Wikipedia.\n\nEveripediais the encyclopedia of everything, where topics are unrestricted, unlike on Wikipedia, Sanger said. More technically, it's a blockchain encyclopedia with a decentralized protocol for accessing and sharing knowledge.\n\nA blockchain is a list of transactions, or a ledger, that can be used to represent a database. By putting all of Everipedia's content on the blockchain, it creates a transparency between writers and readers. When it's all set up, it will be possible for people to propose adding information to the blockchain, Sanger explained, and people who have tokens (which are earned by adding to the blockchain) come to a consensus about what information gets added to the blockchain.\n\n\"In terms of editorial standards, just to get on an encyclopedia blockchain will be relatively easy,\" Sanger said. When the initial protocol is adopted, it should be a very low bar that allows encyclopedia articles to get onto the blockchain, he said. However, the actual editorial decisions that are made won't happen on that level.\n\nDifferent users of the information that make up the blockchain and Everipedia will make the decisions on the ratings of articles, and what order they will be placed. Users will be able to go in, read those articles, and visit our interface to submit their own ratings, he said.\n\nFind out The Next Big Thing and subscribe to TechRepublic's newsletter. Subscribe",

    "title": "iOS 11.4: Here's what business users need to know",
    "text": "Apple's iOS 11.4 has left beta and is now officially available for public installation on compatible iPhones and iPads.\n\nTwo of the three major updates to iOS in 11.4 are centered around the HomePod, Apple's Siri-powered Amazon Echo competitor, adding features such as easier pairing and AirPlay 2-enabled speaker support.\n\nThe biggest change that business users should be aware of is the addition of iCloud storage for iMessages. Users who choose to store iMessages in iCloud will free up device space and automatically sync iMessages across devices, but there is a trade-off: iCloud has been hacked before.\n\nThe more personal, or sensitive business, information you store in iCloud the more you stand to lose if your account is compromised.\n\nStoring iMessages in iCloud: How to do it safely\n\niOS users who want to store their iMessages in iCloud can do so with very few steps: Just open the Settings app, tap on your name, then on iCloud, and make sure the Messages option is toggled on. iOS will then offload all your iMessages to your iCloud storage space and you should see some freed up storage pretty quickly.\n\nIf your iCloud account were to be hacked, however, the attacker could gain access to all your iMessage conversations as well as the attachments they contain.\n\nThere's no surefire way to prevent your iCloud account from being compromised: If an attacker finds a backdoor in Apple's security (which happens with some degree of regularity) they will gain access, like it or not.\n\nSEE: Research: Defenses, response plans, and greatest concerns about cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (Tech Pro Research)\n\nThat doesn't mean you can't defend yourself. The simplest method is to enable two-factor authentication on your iCloud account. Two-factor authentication, like most other methods of cybersecurity, isn't foolproof but it's the best step you can take to avoid ending up like the dozens of celebrities who had their iCloud data stolen in 2014.\n\nA good rule of thumb when it comes to personal cloud storage services like iCloud is to avoid storing anything truly confidential in it. For business users this can be a variety of things-proposals, internal use documents, and other records should only be stored in business-controlled cloud accounts.\n\nShould businesses allow iCloud syncing for iMessages?\n\nBusinesses that use iOS should be wary of allowing users to sync iMessages to iCloud: It's convenient, but it's simply too great a risk for companies concerned with data security.\n\nThe reason why businesses should prevent iCloud users from syncing messages is a matter of Apple's repeated security failures over the past several years. As mentioned in an article on TechRepublic sister site ZDNet, Apple's reputation has taken a big hit in the past few years, and a lot of that is due to its sloppy coding and high-profile software bugs.\n\nIf Apple wants business users to trust it with sensitive data it has some work to do on the security front. Until then, protect yourself by being careful what information-including iMessages-are stored in iCloud.\n\nYou can read the full iOS 11.4 patch notes here.\n\niOS 11.4 has been released, and one of its major new features is the ability to sync iMessages to iCloud.\n\nGiven Apple's recent, and repeated, security failings, business users should avoid trusting sensitive information to iCloud: It's better to wait and see if Apple steps up its security game.\n\nGet a roundup of the biggest Apple headlines by subscribing to our Apple Weekly newsletter.

    "title": "How to build a simple timesheet that accommodates projects in Excel 2016",
    "text": "The article How to build a simple timesheet in Excel 2016 tracks hours worked in a traditional clocking-in- and-out, one-record-per-day structure. That's not always suitable, so in this article, I'll show you a different model that tracks days using a columnar structure rather than the traditional row structure. This model supports projects, as many as you need. You probably won't find a magic bullet with either timesheet model, but you can adjust and customize either model to fit your needs.\n\nI'm using Excel 2016 (desktop) on a Windows 10 64-bit system, but you can use earlier versions. You can use the browser edition to enter your hours. For your convenience, you can download the demonstration .xlsx and .xls files.\n\nAs with any timesheet app that you plan to distribute, you need to consider the following issues:\n\nHow to validate input to eliminate typos and other invalid data. We'll use data validation in two spots.\n\nHow users will access the template. You can distribute it or allow them to access the sheet via a browser or web-based application. This article doesn't extend beyond a local or server file.\n\nHow to protect the template from misuse. Because this model uses a Table object to expand, Excel protection isn't helpful.\n\nHow to secure confidential information, such as social security numbers, if required. Our example doesn't contain any confidential data.\n\nFigure A shows the completed timesheet with all the trimmings. This model supports a seven-day week, beginning with Sunday and ending with Saturday. Unlike the timesheet from the first article, this structure allows you to track hours specific to projects. You can easily adapt this structure to handle more than one week.\n\nWe'll create this simple timesheet that allows you to track time by projects.\n\nThe sheet has an input area for employee, company, and department information, including the time (pay) period. This model doesn't force you to \"clock in.\" Instead, users enter hours by category or project. As such, the user does bear bit more responsibility for tracking actual work hours throughout the day.\n\nSEE: Tap into the power of data validation in Excel (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nThe example uses Sunday to identify the pay period. You could enter a combo control that lists every Sunday of the year, but it would be cumbersome to use. Instead, we'll a validation control that accepts only Sunday dates:\n\nSelect B2. Click the Data tab click Data Validation in the Data Tools group, and then select the Data Validation option from the dropdown list. In the resulting dialog, choose Custom from the Allow dropdown. In the Formula control, enter the following formula (Figure B):\n\n=WEEKDAY($B$2,1)=1 If you like, click the Error Alert tab and enter a meaningful error message, as shown in Figure C. This step isn't necessary for the timesheet to work, but your users will appreciate the information. Click OK.\n\nUse a formula that accepts only Sunday dates.\n\nFigure D shows the result of entering a date that isn't a Sunday. You could continue to limit input values, but we won't do so in this article.\n\nThe data validation control rejects invalid input dates.\n\nThis next step returns the dates in a single pay period by referencing the input date in B2. To start the sequence, enter the following expression in B5:\n\nNext, enter the following expression in C5 and copy it to D5:H5:\n\nTo extend the pay period, simply add more expressions to row 5. For now, the expressions return nothing because B2 is blank. Enter a Sunday date; initially, the expressions return serial values. Apply the Short Date format to B5:H5 to display meaningful dates, as shown in Figure E.\n\nFormat the expressions in row 5 to display dates.\n\nThe next few steps might be confusing as we implement them, but everything will come together in the end, so don't worry. Our structure supports projects, and you can specify as many projects as necessary in a simple list. Later, we'll add a data validation control that references this list.\n\nMove to a new sheet and enter the list shown in Figure F. Next, convert the list to a Table object so it requires no additional work to update:\n\nClick anywhere inside the list. Click the Insert tab and then click the Table option in the Tables group. In the resulting dialog (Figure F), indicate whether your Table has headers-the example Table does. Click OK.\n\nConvert the list to a Table object so you can update it easily.\n\nYou can't directly reference a Table in a data validation control, so let's assign a defined name to the Table. First, we you need to know its name. Click inside the Table and then click the contextual Design tab. You'll find the Table object's name in the Table Name control to the left of the ribbon, as shown in Figure G. (It's often easier to work with a more meaningful name than the one Excel assigns. To rename the Table, click inside the Table Name control, enter a name and press Enter. We won't bother with this example.)\n\nNow you're ready to assign a defined name to the Table as follows:\n\nClick anywhere inside the Table. Click the Formulas tab. In the Defined Names group, click Define Name. In the resulting dialog, enter ProjectList as the Name. Reference the Table using the format =Tablename[Columnheader]. In this case, that's =Table10[Projects], as shown in Figure H. Click OK.\n\nIt seems like you've gone to lot of extra work to create a simple list, but it's worth it. Because the list is a Table object, you can add and delete projects and the data validation control that we'll add later will automatically update, without any extra work on your part.\n\nSEE: 10 Excel time-savers you might not know about (TechRepublic)\n\nWith your projects list in place you're ready to start building the work-hour input ranges. Beginning at A7, and using Figure I as a guide, add a row of header labels and category labels. Be sure to leave a blank row (row 6) between the information input range and the category input range. The white space will help reduce the visual noise.\n\nLeave a blank row between the category Table and the dates.\n\nNext, using the instructions in step 5, convert the category input range (A7:H12) to a Table object. It isn't necessary, but formatting and updating will be easier. (Your formats won't match the figure, so don't worry about that.)\n\nWith the category Table object selected, click the contextual Design tab and check the Total Row option in the Table Style Options group. Select Sum from the dropdown added to B13. Copy that function to C13:H13. Figure I shows the finished category Table input range.\n\nBy making the range a Table, you can easily add or delete new categories, but each category requires only one row per pay period. You can add a new or delete an existing category, but you won't duplicate a category.\n\nNow you're ready to add the project input range, which includes the project data validation control I mentioned earlier. Enter days of the week, Sunday through Saturday in B15:H15-leaving a blank row between the two input ranges. To add the projects data validation control, select A16 and do the following:\n\nClick the Data tab, click Data Validation in the Data Tools group, and then select the Data Validation option from the dropdown list. In the resulting dialog, choose List from the Allow dropdown. In the Source control, enter =ProjectList (Figure J), the defined name you gave to the project list Table object in step 5. If you like, click the Error Alert tab, and enter a meaningful error message. This step isn't necessary for the sheet to work, but your users will appreciate the information. Click OK.\n\nCreate a data validation control that lists the projects.\n\nIn the last step, you converted the category input range to a Table. Do this again, converting the project input range (A15:H16) to a Table (with headers). Then, enable the Total Row as you did for the category Table.\n\nYou may or may not need a project row each week. You could have 0 rows or several, depending on the number of projects you worked on that pay period. The current project list has only two projects, so you'd have up to two rows for the given pay period. If you add a new project next week, you might have up to three rows in this Table. As you add projects using the data validation list, the Table, shown in Figure K, expands. As before, don't worry about Table formats just yet.\n\nThis Table will adjust to the number of projects you work on during the pay period.\n\nTo add a column of category totals, select I8, click AutoSum, highlight B8:H8 and press Enter. Change the default header to Category Totals and increase the column width. Repeat this process to add project totals to the project Table. Be sure to highlight row 16 (AutoSum might try to sum values in column I).\n\nPresently, you have category and project weekly totals in column I and daily subtotals in row 13 and 17. You don't have a daily grand total. Insert two blank rows between row 5 and 7. Select B7 and enter the expression\n\n=Table4[[#Totals],[Sunday]]+Table3[[#Totals],[Sunday]]\n\nCopy it to C7:H7. Instead of entering those long references, you could click B15 and B19.\n\nFigure L shows the timesheet after disabling the gridlines and applying Table formats consistently to both Table objects. It's a bit odd to have grand totals at the top of the sheet, but this position allows the project Table to grow with impunity.\n\nAt this point, your sheet is functional, but there are some things you might want to add. If blank cells are problematic for your accounting system, add zeros to the input ranges in the category and project Table objects. To do so, enter a 0 into an empty cell and copy it to the Clipboard. Then, select B10:H14 (the category input range) and press F5. In the resulting dialog, click Special. Select the Blanks option and click OK. Press Ctrl+v to paste the 0 from the Clipboard into the selected blank cells. Repeat this task for the project Table's input range, B18:H18.\n\nUsers can delete the 0s and accidentally leave blanks, so you might want to consider a conditional formatting rule that highlights blank cells:\n\nAs you add new projects to the project Table, the rule highlights the entire new row because those cells are blank.\n\nMost companies don't allow overtime in the same day that you use comp, sick, or vacation time. You can use the following conditional formatting rule to highlight the values in B12:H14 when the overtime value in row 11 is greater than 0 and the corresponding comp, or sick, or vacation value is greater than 0:\n\nIt won't fix the problem, but it will alert your user that a problem exists.\n\nEach pay period, the user will open the template file and rename it to reflect the current pay period. It's not the only way, of course, but it's the easiest way. Employees can submit a printed copy or the electronic file.\n\nFigure M shows hours accrued for the work week beginning March 25, 2018. Harkins worked a total of 44 hours; 31 in fixed categories and 13 on specific projects. As you can see, there's a problem on Thursday because Harkins is claiming 2 hours of overtime and 2 hours of sick time. The only way to resolve this error is to remove either the overtime or the sick time.\n\nThere's one limitation worth noting: If you work 10 hours on a single project in the same day, you can't identify two of those hours as overtime. Enter 10 in the project row and let payroll staff work out the overtime when applying rates.\n\nNormally you'd protect the sheet before distributing the workbook, but you can't easily protect a sheet with an expanding Table object. For better or worse, you'll have to trust users to be somewhat competent with this timesheet. They always have the template to start fresh, if the worst happens.\n\nGet more great Office tips and tricks delivered to your inbox. Sign up for TechRepublic's Microsoft Weekly newsletter.

    "title": "Two ways to speed up Excel macros",
    "text": "Most of us use macros to automate processes that we repeat or that require specialized knowledge. Regardless of why you use macros, you want them to run as quickly as possible. You can optimize your code by:\n\nDisabling features that update the sheet\n\nIn this article, I'll show you how to make simple changes to your code to optimize it for speed.\n\nI'm using Excel 2016 on a Windows 10 64-bit system, but these tips will work in older versions. The tips are specific to the desktop version because macros don't run in the browser version. There's no demonstration file; you won't need one.\n\nHave you noticed that your screen sometimes flickers while a macro is running? This happens when Excel attempts to redraw the screen to show changes made by the running macro. If screen updates aren't necessary while running the macro, consider disabling this feature so your macro can run a bit faster. Use the following statements to disable and enable this feature:\n\nApplication.ScreenUpdating = False 'macro code Application.ScreenUpdating = True\n\nYou can expect Excel to redraw the screen when the macro completes its work-when you reset the property to True.\n\nDisabling screen updates won't disable the Status Bar, which displays information during normal operations, including what your macro is doing. To disable updates to the Status Bar, use the DisplayStatusBar property as follows:\n\nApplication.ScreenUpdating = False Application.DisplayStatusBar = False 'macro code Application. DisplayStatusBar = True Application.ScreenUpdating = True\n\nIf your macro is analyzing a lot of data, consider setting the Calculation property to Manual while the macro is running. That way, the workbook won't recalculate unless you force it to by pressing F9. Calculation speed probably isn't a large performance factor is most normal workbooks though, and it can have unexpected results, so use it sparingly-as needed:\n\nApplication.Calculation = xlCalculationManual Application.ScreenUpdating = False Application.DisplayStatusBar = False 'macro code Application. DisplayStatusBar = True Application.ScreenUpdating = True Application.Calculation = xlCalculationAutomatic\n\nMacros can trigger unnecessary event procedures. For instance, entering a value into a cell triggers the Worksheet_Change event. A few won't be noticeable, but if the macro is complex enough, you might consider disabling events while the macro is running:\n\nApplication.Calculation = xlCalculationManual Application.ScreenUpdating = False Application.DisplayStatusBar = False Application.EnableEvents = False 'macro code Application.EnableEvents = True Application. DisplayStatusBar = True Application.ScreenUpdating = True Application.Calculation = xlCalculationAutomatic\n\nSimilar to setting the Calculation property to Manual, disabling events can have unexpected results, so use it with careful consideration.\n\nIf you use the macro recorder, you may have noticed that it's fond of using the Select method to explicitly reference things. It works, but it's slow and prone to runtime errors. If you want to start with the recorder, do so. Then, review the resulting code for Select methods and change them to Range references. For example, the following recorder code applies italics to C4:C62:\n\nSub Macro1() Range(\"C4:C62\").Select Selection.Font.Italic = True End Sub\n\nThe recorder uses the Select method to identify the range. Once you know the right methods and properties-Font.Italic = True-you can easily rewrite the macro as follows:\n\nSub Macro2() Range(\"C4:C62\").Font.Italic = True ' Sheets(\"Divisions\").Range(\"C4:C62\").Font.Italic = True ' Range(\"Table3[Species]\").Font.Italic = True End Sub\n\nMacro2() accomplishes the same thing with one line of code and without selecting the range. In short, you simply combine the two statements and delete the Select method and the Selection object. The optimized code is more efficient and less prone to runtime errors.\n\nThe commented lines show the Sheet and Table object references. The sheet reference is necessary only if you want to run the macro outside of the sheet (Divisions, in this case). The Table references the Species column in a Table named Table3.\n\nTo learn more about efficient selection methods when using VBA, read Excel tips: How to select cells and ranges efficiently using VBA.\n\nSimilar to selecting ranges and objects to perform an action in the sheet, an explicit reference to the sheet also slows down processing. The solution is to use variables. For example, the following code references the same cell (value) six times:\n\nFunction ReturnFeeSlow() Select Case Range(\"I4\") Case 1 ReturnFee = Range(\"I4\") * 10 Case 2 ReturnFee = Range(\"I4\") * 20 Case 3 ReturnFee = Range(\"I4\") * 30 Case 4 ReturnFee = Range(\"I4\") * 40 Case 5 ReturnFee = Range(\"I4\") * 50 End Select MsgBox ReturnFee, vbOKOnly End Function\n\nAt the very least, ReturnFeeSlow() makes two explicit references to I4. It's not changing the value, it's using the value in a simple expression. In this case, it's more efficient to define a variable with the value in I4 and use the variable, as follows:\n\nFunction ReturnFeeFast() Dim intFee As Integer intFee = Range(\"I4\").Value Select Case intFee Case 1 ReturnFee = intFee * 10 Case 2 ReturnFee = intFee * 20 Case 3 ReturnFee = intFee * 30 Case 4 ReturnFee = intFee * 40 Case 5 ReturnFee = intFee * 50 End Select MsgBox ReturnFee, vbOKOnly End Function\n\nPlease forgive the obnoxiously contrived examples, but the concept is the point, not the code's purpose. Specifically, built-in updating features and explicit references to the sheet or a range will slow down your code. Admittedly, with today's fast systems, simple macros won't always need optimization. However, if you're working with a complex custom application, these easy-to-implement changes should improve efficiency.\n\nGet more great Office tips and tricks delivered to your inbox.

    "text": "According to Codecademy, 2017 might have been the year of re-education. New research from the online coding resource said more than half of its users this year hold a college degree, using their free time to boost their skill set by learning to code.\n\nAbout 55% of Codecademy's users reported having some kind of college degree, showing that tech professionals are finding ways to expand their resume and stay relevant in a constantly changing field.\n\n\"We're hearing increasingly from people learning to code to get a leg up in their current industry and from people who want to move into tech adjacent fields,\" the report said. \"Considering that this is one of the few sectors of the economy that's growing, it makes sense.\"\n\nSEE: Hiring kit: Python developer (Tech Pro Research)\n\nIn a survey of part of the site's 45 million users, about 40% said they were learning coding skills to enter software development or a similar position. Others said coding was empowering and enabled them to work from home, the report said.\n\nWith multiple reports of a tech skills gap, tech professionals may continue to see online courses, like those at Codecademy, as a way to keep up with new programming languages and refresh pre-existing skills. Online courses may also help those without a degree build the skills employers are looking for.\n\nAbout half of the respondents said they had never taken an university coding course. Of those who had taken an in-person college coding class, 25% made the switch to online courses because they felt they were a safer space to learn a new skill. The report is coming from users who have already begun learning to code online, but the findings may signal a shift to more online courses as a way to boost tech resumes.\n\nAround 10% of respondents said they felt happy when learning in a traditional university setting, the report said. Overall, only 5% of respondents said they were anxious in such a setting, but women were 2.5x more likely to say they were anxious. Online courses may offer women and minorities a chance to learn tech skills without feeling intimidated by typically male-dominated university computer science programs.\n\nThe report found that, while women may feel more empowered in online courses, men are more likely to see a pay raise or promotion due to learning how to code. Men are almost 55% more likely than women to say they made more money due to their new coding skills. Men are 1.5x more likely than women to receive a promotion due to the skills, the survey found.\n\n\"Dozens of programs have sprung up to help women move into careers in tech, but it seems that even when women take all the right steps, they're not seeing the reward,\" the report said of the findings.\n\nDespite women-targeted programs and adjusted entry-level computer science courses, more may need to be done to fight gender disparity in the tech industry.\n\nWant to use these statistics in your next presentation?

    "text": "Google has posted a defense of Gmail's privacy protections after a Wall Street Journal report found the service was allowing third-party companies to read personal emails.\n\nThe WSJ reported that employees at firms offering personalized services, such as shopping and travel suggestions, are accessing and reading Gmail users' messages.\n\nWhile not referencing the story directly, Google Cloud's director of security, trust and privacy, Suzanne Frey, published a post in the wake of the report, in which she outlined Gmail's privacy protections.\n\n\"We continuously work to vet developers and their apps that integrate with Gmail before we open them for general access, and we give both enterprise admins and individual consumers transparency and control over how their data is used,\" she wrote.\n\nSEE: GDPR security pack: Policies to protect data and achieve compliance (Tech Pro Research)\n\nBefore a third-party app can access Gmail messages, Frey says the software is submitted to \"a multi-step review process that includes automated and manual review of the developer, assessment of the app's privacy policy and homepage to ensure it is a legitimate app, and in-app testing to ensure the app works as it says it does\".\n\nA key part of this review is ensuring that apps only collect data they need and don't misrepresent how they are using this data, according to Frey.\n\nThird-party apps need to have been given explicit permission by the user before those apps can access personal data, Frey said, adding that these permissions can be revoked using the Security Checkup page in the user's Google account.\n\nThose concerned about third-party access to their Gmail account can also visit myaccount.google.com and select the Apps with account access page, from which they can revoke any previously-granted permissions.\n\nBusiness users enjoy a wider range of protections, with G Suite admins able to screen connected OAuth apps to limit the data access that individual users are able to grant.\n\nGoogle ceased scanning consumer Gmail messages to personalize ads to users in June last year, a point that Frey stressed in her post yesterday.\n\n\"We do not process email content to serve ads, and we are not compensated by developers for API access. Gmail's primary business model is to sell our paid email service to organizations as a part of G Suite.\"\n\nPublic awareness of privacy issues has been heightened recently, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the data firm was accused of using the personal information of millions of Facebook users to try to change election results.\n\nDespite Google's assurances, David Emm, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, says the WSJ's findings show how important it is for individuals and businesses to pay close attention to the permissions they give third-party apps.\n\n\"We have a right to privacy - but we need to be aware of what terms and conditions we are agreeing to when signing up for free email and social-media accounts, especially regarding the rights we are waiving or the access to data that we are giving away,\" he said.\n\n\"We should also think twice before allowing third-party apps to connect to our accounts.\"\n\nG Suite admins can screen connected OAuth apps to limit the data access that individual users are able to grant.\n\nThose concerned about third-party access to their Gmail account can visit myaccount.google.com and select the Apps with account access page, from which they can revoke any previously-granted permissions.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Tech News You Can Use newsletter.

    "text": "Building a slide deck, pitch, or presentation? Here are the big takeaways:\n\nOverall, iPhone X users gave the product a 97% customer satisfaction rating. - Creative Strategies, 2018\n\nDespite overall customer satisfaction with the iPhone X, device owners had problems with Siri, leaving the digital assistant with a roughly 20% customer satisfaction rating. - Creative Strategies, 2018\n\nFor years Apple has responded to complaints about the functionality of Siri and as more virtual assistants have popped up from their rivals, users continue to grumble about the things it cannot do.\n\nThat was one of the biggest takeaways from a study of iPhone X users conducted by Creative Strategies, Inc. Ben Bajarin, principal analyst and the head of primary research, said in the report that iPhone X owners gave the product \"an overall 97% customer satisfaction. While that number is impressive, what really stands out when you do customer satisfaction studies is the percentage who say they are very satisfied with the product,\" Bajarin wrote.\n\nIn terms of the survey respondents who met that \"very satisfied\" mark, the report found it to be about 85% of iPhone X owners.\n\nSEE: IT leader's guide to the future of artificial intelligence (Tech Pro Research)\n\nBut when the report authors broke it down by specific features, Siri stood out as one of the only things users were not happy with. Every other feature had a customer satisfaction percentage above 60%. Siri was the only feature below that mark at about 20%.\n\nThis figure is more prominent, Bajarin said, because their survey focused on early Apple adoptees, who he said \"tend to be more critical and less satisfied overall than mainstream consumers.\"\n\nThis is good for Apple because of the very high marks almost every other feature received in the survey. But Siri's very low score dovetails with the years of complaints users have had with how Siri functions.\n\nThe Street's Leon Lazaroff wrote that Siri's main problem is a consumer base expecting it to function like other virtual assistants, which it cannot do because it was designed for a very specific purpose.\n\n\"Siri's job is to integrate those devices, it's meant to grease the connections between Apple devices, making the iPhone integral to the iPad, AppleWatch and AppleTV - and all points in between,\" Lazaroff wrote. \"The problem for Apple is that people have come to expect a voice-activated device that can answer relatively easy questions fast and efficiently, and Siri...has mostly fallen short.\"\n\nSiri's inability to answer basic questions like Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana, and Google Assistant has left users confused about what the feature is actually supposed to do.\n\nVerge journalist Walt Mossberg wrote in 2016 that Apple \"wasted its lead\" with Siri and was too slow to add features and functionality that its rivals had already mastered.\n\n\"Siri's huge promise has been shrunk to just making voice calls and sending messages to contacts, and maybe getting the weather, using voice commands. If you try and treat Siri like a truly intelligent assistant, aware of the wider world, it often fails, even though Apple presentations and its Siri website suggest otherwise,\" Mossberg wrote.\n\nA study done by Stone Temple last year found that Siri \"only answered 21.7 percent of questions and nailed 62.2 percent of them completely, correctly,\" noting that \"Alexa and Siri both face the limitation of not being able to leverage a full crawl of the web to supplement their knowledge bases. It will be interesting to see how they both address that challenge.\"\n\nDespite the challenges with Siri, Apple should be heartened to know that most users gave the iPhone X very high scores on almost everything else, and Bajarin said Apple is set up nicely for the future.\n\n\"Overall, the data we collected around iPhone X show that if Apple is truly using this product as the baseline for innovation for the next decade, then they are off to a strong start and have built a solid foundation,\" Bajarin wrote in the report.\n\nBajarin later added: \"If Apple can bring Siri back to a leadership position and in combination continue to build on the hardware and software around iPhone X base foundation, then they will remain well positioned for the next decade.\"\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Apple Weekly newsletter.

    "text": "Building a slide deck, pitch, or presentation? Here are the big takeaways:\n\nInvesting in artificial intelligence (AI) and human-machine collaboration could boost business revenues by 38% by 2022, and raise employment levels by 10%. - Accenture, 2018\n\n61% of senior executives think the share of roles requiring collaboration with AI will rise in the next three years. - Accenture, 2018\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is poised to impact nearly every industry, and businesses that don't take immediate steps to upskill their workforces to collaborate with machines will miss out on revenue, according to a recent report from Accenture Strategy.\n\nIf businesses invest in AI and human-machine collaboration at the same rate as top-performing companies, they could boost revenues by 38% by 2022, the report found, lifting profits by $4.8 trillion globally. These businesses could also raise employment levels by 10% in that timeframe.\n\nBusiness leaders are optimistic about the changes that AI can bring to their organization and workforce, according to the 1,200 senior executives surveyed for the report: 72% said that intelligent technology will be critical to their organization's market differentiation. Further, 61% said the share of roles requiring collaboration with AI will rise in the next three years. And 69% of the 14,000 workers surveyed said that it was important to develop skills to work with these intelligent systems.\n\nSEE: IT leader's guide to the future of artificial intelligence (Tech Pro Research)\n\nHowever, a disconnect remains, as only 3% of business leaders said that their organization plans to significantly increase its investment in reskilling workers in the next three years.\n\n\"To achieve higher rates of growth in the age of AI, companies need to invest more in equipping their people to work with machines in new ways,\" Mark Knickrehm, group chief executive of Accenture Strategy, said in a press release. \"Increasingly, businesses will be judged on their commitment to what we call Applied Intelligence - the ability to rapidly implement intelligent technology and human ingenuity across all parts of their core business to secure this growth.\"\n\nWhile many fear that AI will replace low-level jobs, most businesses are optimistic about the impact on their companies, the report found: 63% of senior executives said they think their company will create net job gains in the next three years due to AI, while 62% of workers said they believe AI will have a positive impact on their work.\n\nHere are three ways business leaders can shape their future workforce in the age of AI, according to Accenture:\n\n1. Reimagine work by configuring work from the bottom up\n\nSome 46% of business leaders agreed that job descriptions are already obsolete, and 29% said they have redesigned jobs extensively. Leaders should assess tasks rather than jobs, and then allocate those tasks to both machines and people. This balance the need to automate work and to elevate your worker's capabilities.\n\n2. Pivot the workforce to areas that unlock new forms of value\n\nLeaders should go beyond process efficiencies to prepare their workforce to create new customer experiences, Accenture recommends. This might mean finding new growth models by reinvesting savings gained from automation into the future workforce. It also requires a new leadership mindset that values long-term transformation opportunities.\n\nDetermine your workforce's current skillset, and their willingness to learn how to work with AI. You can then use digital platforms to target different areas of the workforce with personalized learning opportunities.\n\n\"Business leaders must take immediate steps to pivot their workforce to enter an entirely new world where human ingenuity meets intelligent technology to unlock new forms of growth,\" Ellyn Shook, chief leadership and human resources officer at Accenture, said in the release. \"Workers are impatient to collaborate with AI, giving leaders the opportunity to demonstrate true Applied Intelligence within their organization.\"\n\nKeep up to date on all of the newest tech trends.

    "title": "3 tips for selecting the best project management software for your business",
    "text": "According to software rating and review site Capterra, there are over 600 project management solutions. However, not all PM software will work in every industry, company, or project size and type. Here are three steps to help your company select the right software to suit your project needs.\n\nGather all the details about your business and how it operates. Factor in company size, hierarchy, how departments and units are structured, and how they interact. Also, analyze products or services, culture, and the available internal and outsourced talent. Some other factors to consider include internal policies, technology, internal views, project methodologies, long-term goals, and finances. These have the potential to create alignment issues with the way your business operates or manage projects.\n\nBefore choosing PM software, evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your business. This in-depth analysis may slow the selection process down, and take time and effort, but it is an essential exercise that will help all stakeholders avoid disappointment, wasted time, and potentially unnecessary costs. Having a big-picture view can reduce the risk of selecting a solution that does not align well with the long-term strategy or the unique inner workings of your business.\n\nSEE: Managing vendor relationships: Time commitment, benefits, and pain points (Tech Pro Research)\n\n2. Identify projects and confirm PM software will sufficiently support all aspects.\n\nWork with business leaders to identify and document high-level details about upcoming projects, both short and long-term. Record as much detail as possible; this information will be required when sending requests for information (RFIs), requests for proposals(RFPs), or requests for quotes (RFQs) to software vendors.\n\nTo ensure the a particular solution can meet your short and long-term goals, pay close attention to the details provided to make sure project requirements are properly and fully addressed in vendor documents.\n\nLook for features that work for your specific project needs. Just because a vendor offers more features than other vendors does not make it the best choice for your company's projects. Make sure the solution can accommodate your key processes and methodologies and that it is scalable and customizable. Also take the time to make sure the vendor can complete onboarding within your company's budget and schedule.\n\nSEE: How to build a successful project manager career (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nWhenever possible, take the opportunity to do a trial run of the fully-working version of the software your company intends to implement. Again, involve key participants in this step to sufficiently test all the required features to make sure each meets your project needs. This may require people from many different areas of the company: make sure frontline users are okay with the system, as well as IT specialists. This is the final gateway before onboarding and reduces the costly buyer's remorse that companies encounter all too often.\n\nEvaluating your internal business environment, identifying potential short and long-term projects, confirming sufficient support, and doing a trial run of software can help your company select the right solution to suit your project needs.\n\nFor more project management and business leadership advice, subscribe to our Executive Briefing newsletter.

    "title": "Machine learning business use will double by end of 2018, report says",
    "text": "Medium and large enterprises are set to double their usage of machine learning by the end of 2018, according to a new report from professional services firm Deloitte.\n\nThe number of machine learning pilots and implementations will double by the end of 2018, and then will double from that number by the end of 2020, Deloitte's report predicts. Businesses spent $17 billion on the technology in 2017, and that is expected to increase to $57.6 billion by 2021.\n\nDeloitte identified five factors that have held back machine learning growth: Too few practitioners, high costs, tools are too young, confusing models, and business regulations.\n\nSEE: Quick glossary: Artificial intelligence (Tech Pro Research)\n\nThe estimated growth shows how as the technology evolves, buy-in from businesses may increase, whether they're using it to improve workflows or create new products. If businesses opt to not adopt the technology, they may risk falling behind others.\n\nThe report looked at other emerging technologies, including augmented reality (AR). One billion smartphones will create AR content at least once in 2018, the report found, with 300 million using AR at least monthly. In what used to just mean an animated face filter on Snapchat or Instagram, AR will expand to other uses for mobile devices.\n\nLast week, Apple named AR as one of its breakout app trends of 2017. Deloitte predicts direct revenues from AR on smartphones will hit $1 billion by 2020, growing tenfold from 2018. With the trend continuing to grow, developers and brands may need to find ways to integrate AR into an app to stay up-to-date and entertain users.\n\nWhile Deloitte expects less than $100 million in discrete app revenues for AR content globally in 2018, it could drive sales in other ways. The ability to simply host AR content may be a key difference to consumers looking to switch or upgrade devices.\n\nIn good news for business travelers, the Deloitte report also found in-flight connectivity (IFC) will be up 20% in 2018. One-quarter of all airline passengers will fly on a plane with access to the internet. Business travelers will have a higher chance they will be able to connect in the air, enabling them to get more work done in transit.\n\nThe 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers\n\nBusinesses will double their usage of machine learning by the end of 2018, a new Deloitte report found. So far, the technology has been held back by regulations, evolving tools, high costs, and few practitioners. The projected growth, expected to hit $57.6 billion in spending by 2021, shows how it is being increasingly utilized as a business tool. Those not currently planning on using machine learning in their business may need to reconsider, or risk being left behind.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Tech News You Can Use newsletter.

    "text": "A built-in keylogger has been discovered on a host of HP laptops for the second time in 2017.\n\nThe hidden software was discovered by security blogger Michael Myng, who also goes by the handle ZwClose. According to Myng's post, he found the keylogger in the keyboard driver when he was looking for more information on how the keyboards on certain models were backlit.\n\n\"The keylogger saved scan codes to a WPP trace. The logging was disabled by default but could be enabled by setting a registry value (UAC required),\" Myng wrote in the post.\n\nSEE: Information security incident reporting policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nAfter Myng initially noticed what looked like the format string for a keylogger, he began to dig deeper. However, without having an HP laptop of his own, he couldn't look as deeply as he wanted to, the post said. So, he reached out to HP.\n\nAfter messaging HP, the company replied to Myng and confirmed the keylogger, which he noted was actually a debug trace. A patch has since been released that removes the keylogger, but users must update their machines to get it.\n\nHP has since launched a web page with all the relevant information for which laptop models are affected, including link to the update. The issue affects commercial notebooks, mobile thin clients, mobile workstations, and consumer laptops as well. HP users should check the list of affected devices on the web page to see if their model is listed.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't the first time a keylogger has been found on HP laptops. Back in May 2017, a keylogger was found in an audio driver package present in many HP laptops, according to security firm ModZero.\n\nWhile neither instance of the keylogger may have been malicious, the presence of such surveillance software could be detrimental to HP's brand image among consumers. Personal privacy is a major concern among users, and any software that seems like it could potentially violate that privacy could drive users away.\n\nThe 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers\n\nA built-in keylogger was found in a huge number of HP laptops by security blogger Michael Myng, also known as ZwClose. Found in the keyboard driver, the keylogger saved scan codes to a WPP trace, but it was disabled by default, Myng reported in his post.

    "title": "Why Docker's survival depends on money from customers, not investors",
    "text": "Docker is apparently about to raise another $75 million in venture capital funding, bringing its total raised to roughly $250 million. If only it could raise similar amounts from paying customers.\n\nEven as containers have gone mainstream, with enterprises embracing them en masse, Docker, the company, has largely missed out. Though this new round brings the company's value to $1.3 billion, that number has hardly moved from Docker's $1 billion valuation back in 2015. Investors clearly continue to have an appetite for Docker's potential, but unless the company does something drastic to super-charge its appeal to paying enterprises, other companies like Red Hat will continue to mint money on the container revolution that Docker kickstarted.\n\nYou've seen it before: The hearty congratulations on Twitter to startups that raise a big round of funding. Too often, however, venture money isn't a sign of success-it means a company still hasn't figured out how to make money, so it's buying time with VC money. While venture money can be used to fuel growth, too often companies use it as an excuse to put off the inevitable, difficult task of making money.\n\nSEE: Docker rocker: container technology usage doubles; serious money follows (ZDNet)\n\nI should know. I've lived it, working for a range of open source startups that each struggled to make money. My most recent startup, MongoDB, seems to have cracked the code on revenue, with indications that it has now surpassed $100 million in annual revenue. But, it wasn't venture capital that delivered the revenue. Instead, a new, highly sales and operations-minded CEO, Dev Ittycheria, joined the company and started forcing hard decisions to turn a hugely successful open source project into a hard-headed open source business.\n\nDocker, however, has yet to make this shift.\n\nYes, the company hired a new CEO, Steve Singh, the former CEO of Concur Technologies. Like Ittycheria, Singh may well bring discipline and a sales-minded culture to Docker. Indeed, according to the funding rumors, a significant share of the funding is intended to build out a sales and marketing machine. If so, that's really good news, as Docker's current revenue is paltry compared to its popularity, as several sources close to the company have shared with me. Even if you don't believe the inside sources, the company's valuation growing just $300,000 over two years is testimony enough that Docker has yet to crack the revenue code.\n\nThe problem for Docker, however, is that other companies are minting lots of revenue from containers, even as it searches for the right approach.\n\nIt's not hard to find competitors currently collecting copious cash from the container fever Docker did most to spark. Google, Microsoft, and AWS are all earning healthy returns on containers within their clouds, but Red Hat, more than any other company, offers the most painful slap in the face.\n\nTwo years ago, Cloud Technology Partners' Mike Kavis highlighted a few reasons that Docker was (then) worth $1 billion after its funding round. Each of those, however, points to Red Hat as a bigger beneficiary of the container mania than Docker, given that Red Hat wisely chose to build on community darling Kubernetes. In his post, Kavitz talked about Docker as sitting at the center of a future of distributed applications, its affinity for hybrid architectures, and its robust ecosystem, among other things.\n\nSEE: Special report: Riding the DevOps revolution (free PDF)\n\nBut each of these areas is more likely to favor Kubernetes, which has become the center of the container ecosystem precisely because it's how enterprises choose to manage containers at scale. Add Kubernetes' traction to Red Hat's longstanding ability to sell into the enterprise and it starts to become clear how hard Docker has made things for itself by delaying a real revenue model for so long.\n\nIs it too late? No. But Docker, despite rightly getting credit for fostering the container market, is the underdog, and not nearly as well-equipped as Red Hat to make money from containers. With every major tech vendor firmly behind Kubernetes, Red Hat has wind in its sails as its Kubernetes-based OpenShift competes against a Docker whose management tooling has the benefit of being closely aligned with the company that invented the container standard, but also the detriment of not being tied to the community managing those containers with Kubernetes.\n\nDocker is by no means doomed, but it has serious work to do-the dull, grinding work of sales.\n\nClick here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Data Center Trends newsletter.

    "title": "Why some of the world's biggest companies are using AI to manage human employees",
    "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) may end up displacing more than just entry-level work, taking over management roles at some of the biggest companies in the world, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\n\nIt all started in the gig economy, the report explained. Firms like Uber, for example, use machine learning and related technologies to manage some of the tasking assignments for the self-employed people who work through their platforms.\n\nHowever, now legacy organizations like GE and Shell are also jumping on the AI bandwagon, rolling out tools to their full-time workforce as well, The Wall Street Journal reported. The tech tools are handling tasks such as \"scheduling and shepherding strategic projects,\" the Journal reported, and researchers cited said that this could lead to the elimination of certain management roles of the displacing of other managers.\n\nSEE: IT leader's guide to the future of artificial intelligence (Tech Pro Research)\n\nThese types of machine learning and AI software are also being leveraged in hiring and human resources as well, with Gartner predicting 25% growth in the overall human resources and workforce management software market by 2020.\n\nSo, what makes AI so well-suited to take over certain management roles? It's all in the data.\n\nAI is good at making decisions based almost solely on available data. Humans can use data, but can also lean on their own intuition or fall into confirmation bias, the report said. AI could potentially help make more objective business decisions, but these tools and platforms could also have their own biases introduced by the humans that create them.\n\nTomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a professor of business psychology at University College London, told The Wall Street Journal that managers primarily work to \"identify potential, build teams, assign tasks, measure performance and provide feedback\"-things that he said humans are not proficient at. However, AI can use data to do perform these tasks, which could lead to a day when we no longer need human managers, Chamorro-Premuzic said.\n\nDespite the use of AI in management, some companies utilize the technology only to eliminate administrative tasks, the report said. One also has to question the value of automating that may have been relegated to middle management-a demographic that's true value has been brought into question over the past few years and that has been shrinking in many organizations as they move toward more flat organizational structures. Of course, this further begs the question of what value can be gleaned from automating a position that may have been on the road to elimination anyway.\n\nThe 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal report, some of the world's biggest companies like Uber, GE, and Shell are using AI and machine learning to complete management tasks. AI excels at certain management tasks because of its ability to make decisions that can be more data-centric than those made by humans, but biases may still remain. The tasks that AI does well could likely be ascribed to middle management, a professional demographic that is shrinking as some companies move to a flatter organizational structure.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Next Big Thing newsletter.

    "title": "Why non-IT employees are now driving decisions about SaaS and cloud applications",
    "text": "Ryan Duguid, SVP of technology strategy at Nintex, spoke with TechRepublic's Dan Patterson about the role of non-IT employees in cloud transitions.\n\nWatch the video or read the transcript of their conversation below:\n\nPatterson: The cloud has had an undeniably transformative effect on the enterprise and SaaS, of course, is at the heart of cloud growth. Now, the growth of SaaS might be up to non-IT workers.\n\nRyan, thank you very much for your time today. I wonder if we could first define how SaaS has grown historically to this point, and then we'll talk a little bit about why it's up to non-IT employees to help the growth of the cloud, and cloud-based applications.\n\nDuguid: Certainly, so at the end of the day, the massive upswing in SaaS is driven for obvious reasons, right? There's cost savings associated with it, a lack of requirement for as many IT administrators to keep the lights on, but fundamentally, I think it's about speed of delivery of technology to the business, and that's always been a problem in the IT sector, and SaaS really makes the promise to solve that problem.\n\nPatterson: So what is it about SaaS that has either reached an apex, or what is it that is now demanding non-IT employees to buy in as well?\n\nDuguid: I think there's two parts to this, right? The first part is that at the end of the day, SaaS has largely been driven by demand from the business. IT historically has struggled to keep up with the requirements of the business, and so the business is constantly pushing for the latest and greatest technology.\n\nI think the other side of it, is now there's a proliferation of SaaS vendors out there, when in the early days it was the big boys like the Workdays, and Salesforce and the likes. There's not a SaaS application for everything, for every business function, for every industry, no matter how large or small, and so as a result there's really this thirst or appetite for the business to get in and self-serve, even if IT's not willing to be a part of that journey.\n\nPatterson: Can you give us a profile of some of the IT and business technology decision makers who are now involved in the process of adopting SaaS solutions for the enterprise?\n\nSEE: Vendor Relationship Policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nDuguid: Certainly, it's the typical players, so it's everything from the CIO down to the VP's and directors of IT within an organization, but more importantly now what we're starting to see is a lot of decisions being made by what we call line of business IT. Essentially, very smart technology-focused individuals within a particular department. So, for example, in the sales department, you'll typically find a Salesforce administrator whose responsible for the deployment, the management, the feeding and nurturing of their Salesforce CRM, and so you're starting to see a lot more of that type of role turn up within an organization, whether they're responsible for Salesforce's CRM, your human capital management systems or the likes, but it's more of a de-centralized type of IT and larger organizations.\n\nPatterson: Ryan, I wonder if you could leave us with a forecast, perhaps the next 6, 12, 18, months in the growth of not just SaaS, but the cloud, the multi-cloud and post-GDPR?\n\nDuguid: Ha ha, post-GDPR. You know, I guess GDPR and other associated compliance requirements are sort of the stick that people wave to try and slow this down, but at the end of the day, the prediction I'd give is there's no stopping this, right? This is how technology is delivered to the business now. It meets the needs of the business, the pace, it helps people tackle digital transformation, get ahead of disruptive competitors in the marketplace, and so I think you're just going to see more and more, and from our perspective at Nintex what we're really fascinated by is the concept of IT and the business working together, where IT is empowering the business to get their jobs done with SaaS platforms. But the business is the ones choosing the technology. It's done with the right level of governance and control, but at the same time it's delivered with the ease and flexibility that helps the average employee get their job done more effectively.\n\nFor more on SaaS and cloud, subscribe to our Cloud Insights newsletter.

    "text": "Building a slide deck, pitch, or presentation? Here are the big takeaways:\n\nDrupal developers have announced another emergency patch for release on Wednesday. Drupal administrators are advised to patch urgently.\n\nLast month's Drupalgeddon 2 vulnerability is presently being exploited by at least three different malware families.\n\nOnce again, the developers of Drupal are preparing an emergency out-of-band patch for a critical vulnerability in the popular content management system. The security advisory indicates that another patch will be released between 16:00 - 18:00 UTC on April 25th, 2018. (For reference, that is between 12:00 - 2:00 pm on the same day, in Eastern Daylight Time.) Patches will be provided for the 7.x, 8.4.x, and 8.5.x branches of Drupal.\n\nSpecific details of the vulnerability are unclear, as the developers have not provided any hints of the nature of the issue prior to the release of the patch. However, the advisory does note that it is a follow-up to the patch issued last month in response to the \"Drupalgeddon 2\" security vulnerability, which related to a conflict between how PHP handles arrays in parameters, and Drupal's use of the hash (#) at the beginning of array keys to signify special keys that typically result in further computation.\n\nIn order to patch that vulnerability, an input sanitation check was added to /includes/bootstrap.inc in the Drupal code. Noted developer Scott Arciszewski of Paragon Initiative indicated that the new vulnerability \"probably doesn't involve breaking the PHP interpreter.\"\n\nSEE: Information security incident reporting policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nDespite the care to pre-announce an urgent out-of-band vulnerability by the developers, seemingly many Drupal installations remain unpatched. The Muhstik botnet has been observed by Netlab 360 infecting vulnerable Drupal instances and implanting xmrig and cgminer cryptocurrency mining software. The Netlab 360 report posits that propagation is also happening from the servers with infected Drupal instances. The botnet is also targeting since-patched vulnerabilties in ClipBucket, DasanNetwork Solution, Webdav, WebLogic, Webuzo, and WordPress, the report said. In addition to Muhstik, two other groups of malware have also been identified as actively exploiting the vulnerability.\n\nContent management systems such as Drupal, as well as blogging platforms like WordPress, are popular targets for hackers, due to their widespread nature. Drupal's usage statistics page indicates the software powers about 1.1 million websites. In particular, Drupal has been susceptible to major vulnerabilities, as the original \"Drupalgeddon\" SQL injection vulnerability from 2014 showed.\n\nFor administrators of Drupal installations that for whatever reason are unable to be patched, Trend Micro's Deep Security package offers filters for the original Drupalgeddon 2 vulnerability to prevent attackers from taking control of vulnerable systems.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

    "text": "Building a slide deck, pitch, or presentation? Here are the big takeaways:\n\nGoogle has announced Partner Interconnect, which allows SMBs to establish a semi-dedicated connection of partial circuits between 50Mbps and 10Gbps.\n\nAt launch, 23 connection partners globally are participating in the Google Partner Interconnect cloud service.\n\nGoogle has announced Google Cloud Partner Interconnect, a flexible means of establishing a direct connection between an on-premises data center and Google's platform for hybrid cloud deployments. Partner Interconnect allows organizations to connect to Google Cloud through 23 partners around the globe, according to a Google press release.\n\nWhile Google's Dedicated Interconnect offering-which reached general availability last October-is only available in 10Gbps full circuits, Partner Interconnect allows users to select partial circuits from 50Mbps to 10Gbps to meet the requirements of SMBs, the release said.\n\nParticipating partners include AT&T, Cologix, Internet2, and Verizon in North America; AT TOKYO, KDDI, NRI, NTT, and Softbank in Japan; BT, Orange, Telemares, and Telia Carrier in EMEA; and Macquarie and Megaport in Australia, as well as Colt, DE-CIX, Digital Realty, Equinix, IXReach, Level3, Tata Communications, and Zayo globally.\n\nGoogle Cloud product manager John Veizades noted in the release that establishing a Partner Interconnect connection is easy, as \"our partners have already set up and certified the infrastructure with Google Cloud. This provides a turnkey solution that minimizes the effort needed to bring up network connectivity from your data center to GCP.\"\n\nSEE: Quick glossary: Hybrid cloud (Tech Pro Research)\n\nThis announcement is part of Google's renewed interest in catering to businesses relying on hybrid cloud installations. With these new connection solutions, businesses deploying hybrid cloud can use Google Cloud services without having their data pushed through the public internet, while also providing greater control over how data is routed across the network, the release noted. This greatly reduces access time and latency in comparison to pure public cloud deployments.\n\nHowever, data transmitted over these connections is not encrypted by default, requiring users to use application-level encryption. For organizations hesitant to commence hybrid cloud deployments due to data security concerns stemming from allowing any outside traffic, the added control over the flow of data across a Partner Interconnect connection may be adequate to ease concerns.\n\nIn addition to Partner and Dedicated Interconnect options, Google has announced a number of collaborations over the last year in an attempt to entice organizations looking to deploy hybrid cloud. In October, Google and Cisco announced a new integration allowing applications to be deployed across on-premises and Google Cloud, as a counter to the similar partnership between AWS and VMWare. Similarly, Google and Nutanix announced a deal last June to allow on-premises and cloud deployments to be managed as a unified service.\n\nGeneral availability for Partner Interconnect is expected in the coming weeks, according to the release. For disambiguation, the Google Cloud product originally called Interconnect was renamed to \"Carrier Peering\" last year, following the release of Direct Interconnect.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cloud Insights newsletter.

    "title": "Cracking open Nintendo's NES Classic Edition game console",
    "text": "If you're a gamer who grew up in the 1980s (like me), odds are you helped Link rescue Princess Zelda or Mario defeat King Bowser on a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Thirty-plus years later, Nintendo is helping those gamers relive their old-school victories with the NES Classic Edition.\n\nReleased in November 2016, the NES Classic Edition is a pint-size version of the original system. It comes with a single two-button controller and 30 preloaded games, including old favorites like Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, Donkey Kong, Metroid and Ghosts'n Goblins. The original NES Classic Edition was discontinued in April 2017. Nintendo has said that that console will return to stores on June 29, 2018.\n\nHow did Nintendo pack so much 8-bit fun into a single box? To find out, I broke out my tools.\n\nNote: This story originally ran in the Fall 2017 issue of CNET Magazine. We're publishing the story online to coincide with our Cracking Open video of the NES Classic and the original NES.\n\nI started with the four rubber pads, or feet, on the console's bottom. Using a thin Phillips screwdriver, I removed the pads and the tiny screw hidden underneath each one. I then lifted off the upper half of the system's plastic case to reveal the tech inside.\n\nThough it's less than a quarter the size of the original NES, the Classic Edition's interior is far less cramped. Gone are the front-loading, VCR-esque cartridge tray, the 72-pin cartridge connector that failed so often and the bulky video, audio and power circuitry. All that 1980s tech has been condensed down to a single main circuit board that's about the size of a drink coaster.\n\nAfter disconnecting the cables for the two game controller ports and a thin cable for the power and reset buttons, I removed a few more screws, lifted off the metal shield that covers the main circuit board and took out the board itself.\n\nNext, I removed the two controller ports, each held in place with a small bracket and single screw. To finish, I only had to disconnect a black, plastic housing that contains a small circuit board to which the contacts for the power and reset buttons are mounted along with the front LED. My teardown of the console was complete.\n\nTurning my attention to the game controller, I removed six screws from the bottom of its clamshell case and then separated the two halves. Inside is a single rectangular circuit board.\n\nThe entire cracking-open process took less than 15 minutes and was the simplest teardown I've ever done.\n\nSimple to crack open: The only tool you really need to disassemble the NES Classic Edition is a small Phillips screwdriver (#00 or #000 should work). There's no glue inside the console or the controller, all the internal components are easily accessible and the screws are all the same diameter and length.\n\nMore tech packed into a smaller package: The Classic Edition has a quad-core ARM processor, 256MB of RAM and 512MB of storage. For comparison, the original NES had an 8-bit processor, 2KB of work RAM, 2KB of video RAM and no game storage.\n\nNES emulator on a single-board computer: The Classic Edition is basically a Nintendo-sanctioned NES emulator running on a Linux single-board computer. Yes, Linux. And if you're wondering whether it's possible to hack the Classic Edition and load more games? That answer is also yes. There's plenty of information on the internet that will show you how to update the system's software and install additional games. But be warned: There's always a chance that modifying your system could cause irreparable damage. More importantly, downloading and using games for which you don't already own a license for is usually illegal.\n\nYesterday's games running on today's tech\n\nThe NES Classic Edition is pure retro gaming fun. It's a much easier way to play old NES games than hunting through flea markets or online auctions for original hardware. And, it's less complicated (and more legal) than running emulator software with downloaded games on a PC.\n\nUnfortunately, after selling over 2 million Classic Editions, Nintendo unexpectedly discontinued the console in April 2017. If you didn't manage to scoop one up then, you may still be able to buy one online, albeit at a likely inflated price. It's also being released again on June 29. We shelled out $200 for the one I cracked open, which is way more than the $60, \u00a350 or AU$100 retail price.\n\nPerhaps what stood out the most to me after cracking open the NES Classic Edition was just how much technology has improved in the past three decades. The hardware inside the Classic Edition is tiny compared with the original system, yet it's so much more powerful. I can't wait to see how far technology advances in the next 30 years.\n\nUpdate, May 29 at 5:55 p.m. PT: Added information about the NES Classic Edition returning to stores in June 2018.",

    "title": "Microsoft SharePoint tip: Clean up OneDrive syncing to reduce confusion",
    "text": "One of the major benefits of using Microsoft SharePoint to create a central location where team members can collaborate on documents and other important tasks is file synchronization. Whenever a change in a document or other file is made in a SharePoint folder, it gets propagated to the cloud and every other device connected to that server. This important function is handled by the same syncing application that controls Microsoft OneDrive.\n\nUnfortunately, there is more than one version of the OneDrive syncing app. This fact can sometimes create unnecessary and often frustrating confusion. Subscribers to Microsoft Office 365 have their version of OneDrive, while purchasers of the standalone version of Office 2016 are often using a version known as OneDrive for Business. Recently, Microsoft decided to remove some of the confusion by consolidating the syncing software into one version of OneDrive.\n\nHowever, the transition to a single version of OneDrive has been, to put it politely, rough, which has caused even more confusion and frustration. As you can see in Figure A, I found myself in a situation where I had both the Office 365 OneDrive version and the OneDrive for Business version running at the same time. It led to major instability, long boot times, and general annoyance.\n\nOf course, as an Office 365 subscriber, it would be best for me to use just the Office 365 OneDrive. But getting rid of the older version is not as simple as uninstalling it. Removing OneDrive for Business requires a bit of trickery. Here is how I did it.\n\nIf you are using SharePoint with Office 365, which is what I recommend, you want to be using the Office 365 version of OneDrive. The easiest way to get it is to log into the online version of SharePoint, navigate to the folder you want to sync, and then click the sync button. If you are not using the latest OneDrive software, the system will prompt you for permission to upgrade.\n\nBut before you do, be sure to synchronize all your documents so that what is online is up to date and what you want propagated across devices. After that, uninstall whatever OneDrive you have installed on your devices. This is your best chance for a clean install of the software. If you don't, you could end up like me-inadvertently running two versions of OneDrive.\n\nSEE: 30 things you should never do in Microsoft Office (free TechRepublic PDF)\n\nIf you do find your device is running two versions of OneDrive, you may find that clicking the inviting Uninstall button in the Start Menu (Figure B) just doesn't work. In my case, that link just took me to the application list, where the only OneDrive application that could be removed was the new version-there was no separate entry for OneDrive for Business.\n\nMy assumption was that there were remnants of entries buried deep inside the Windows Registry that were continuing to call upon the old application. I tried changing the name of the old OneDrive app, but that just caused errors. My internet research suggested using a third-party app like CCleaner, but I was not sure which entries to delete and which to leave alone. Obviously, something else had to be done.\n\nI decided to use the Group Policy Editor to try to reestablish the correct OneDrive parameters. Here are the steps to take.\n\nFirst, right-click on the Windows 10 Start Menu and click the Command Prompt (Admin) menu entry. Type this application name at the prompt and press Enter:\n\nThat will open the Group Editor.

    "title": "6 tips for managing your mental bandwidth",
    "text": "Time is an interesting thing. It's the one \"commodity\" that cannot be created or destroyed, and you can't acquire more than 24 hours each day. What we do with those 24 hours ultimately impacts everything from our long-term success to how we relate with the important people in our lives.\n\nKey to utilizing our limited amount of time is successfully allocating our mental focus, or to use the technology vernacular, our \"mental bandwidth.\" Just as you can only perform so many simultaneous computing tasks for a given amount of network bandwidth, so too can we as human only focus on, and be successful at, a certain amount of tasks. Here are some tips for managing your mental bandwidth.\n\nThe world is ripe with prescriptive advice, yet as individuals what works for me may not work for you, and oftentimes the advice is conflicting. For instance, a penny saved might be a penny earned, yet we're also told not to be penny smart and pound foolish.\n\nThe same holds true with advice for mental bandwidth, where one \"reputable\" source might encourage multitasking, while another demand absolute singularity of focus. Rather than trying to adapt your working style to someone else's, experiment with different techniques and keep those that help, while casting aside those that don't, even if they work for a well-regarded guru, loved one, or friend. There's no harm in mixing, modifying, and abandoning in an effort to find techniques that work best for how your individual brain is \"wired.\"\n\n2. Actively manage your mental bandwidth\n\nPerhaps the biggest mistake many people make is allowing their mental bandwidth to be managed for them. The beeping phone, meeting request, or act performed for ritual or obligation all rob our limited mental bandwidth, and many perform these actions unquestioningly. If you allocate your focus as you see fit, and actively choose what you want to focus on, you'll be in command of your mental bandwidth even when faced with unmovable obligations ranging from work to civic duties.\n\nSEE: Time management tips for tech professionals (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nMost of us are awash in meeting requests and accept without question. Everyone complains about excessive meetings, yet it's often a guilty pleasure to summon a group at your whim, or join a discussion under the assumption that your input is necessary and valuable. In the worst case, this might extend to accepting vague requests for \"coffee\" or \"catch-up\" sessions without thinking through whether the commitment is worth the cost in allocating your focus elsewhere. The world is awash in advice on how to make meetings more productive; simply asking yourself whether requesting or attending is worth the cost in mental bandwidth is a great start.\n\nThere are tasks that require great focus, whether performing precision or dangerous manual work, or designing a complex system or bit of code. Or, you may need to spend some time with a small group, free from distraction. Book a block in your calendar, shut off your phone, move to a different physical location, or do whatever is required to create the right circumstances to have the necessary focus to get the job done. Creating the right environment and circumstances can be a critical element in how you'll deploy your mental bandwidth to achieve the best result.\n\nThankfully, most work cultures are evolving away from rewarding \"time served\" to outcomes produced, but for many of us it can be tempting to put in the extra hour at the office, or delay vacations for what's perceived as a critical set of meetings or deadlines. Trying to squeeze out the last ounce of mental bandwidth can be tempting in the moment, but it's ultimately an effort with rapidly diminishing returns. Calling it a night, taking that long-delayed vacation, or even the simple act of a quick walk around the office will recharge your mental energy and make you more effective in the long run.\n\n6. Don't make assumptions about your team\n\nA locked door and giant pair of headphones might be just the thing you need to focus and deploy your mental energies most effectively. It can be tempting to assume that what works for you will be effective for others, even to the point of designing your physical spaces and policies around what you assume will allow your team to best manage and deploy their mental bandwidth. Rather than assuming, ask your team how you can help them be most effective. Allow your teams to experiment and find what works for them, and use the end result as the benchmark for success, rather than trying to dictate that everyone adapt the exact same working style.\n\nFor more business and leadership advice, subscribe to our Executive Briefing newsletter.

    "title": "Pro time saver: Amazon Key can deliver packages to your car in office parking lot",
    "text": "Building a slide deck, pitch, or presentation? Here are the big takeaways:\n\nAmazon Key will now deliver packages into a customer's vehicle at no extra charge, saving them time and money.\n\nProfessionals can have packages delivered to their car in the office parking lot, which is more professional than fielding personal deliveries inside the office.\n\nAmazon Prime members can now have their Amazon orders delivered directly into their car through Amazon Key, the company announced in a Tuesday press release.\n\nAmazon Key was originally touted as the service for delivering packages directly into the home of the recipient. Now, however, the Amazon Key In-Car service will deliver packages into compatible vehicles as long as they are parked somewhere that is publicly accessible, like a work or home address, the press release said.\n\nAmazon Key In-Car is now available in 37 US cities, and currently works with 2015 or newer Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac with OnStar; and 2015 or newer Volvo cars with Volvo On Call, according to an Amazon spokesperson.\n\nSEE: Workplace safety policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\n\"To get started, customers download the Amazon Key App and then link their Amazon account with their connected car service account,\" the release said. \"Once setup is complete and the delivery location has been registered, customers can shop on Amazon.com and select the \"In-Car\" delivery option at checkout.\"\n\nAmazon customer Scott L. from Miami noted in the release that he setup the service with his OnStar-equipped car, only giving Amazon permission to unlock the trunk and re-lock the vehicle. And each time a delivery driver requests access to the customer's car, it's done through an encrypted authentication process, the release said. Once the driver is confirmed to be at the right place with the right package, the car is unlocked. \"No special codes or keys are ever provided to delivery drivers,\" the release said.\n\nOn delivery day, customers must confirm they are parked within range of the delivery location and are then given a 4-hour window for when the delivery will take place.\n\nAmazon Key In-Car is safer than having a package delivered to one's porch, as thefts of online purchases have skyrocketed. But, it's also less invasive than allowing someone into a home, as is the process with the traditional Amazon Key delivery service.\n\nFor professionals, Amazon Key In-Car can save time and provide piece of mind by having packaged delivered into a car parked in the office parking lot. It's also a lot more professional than having personal packages delivered to the office during the work day.\n\nWith Key and Key In-Car, Amazon is working to blend the digital transformation of e-commerce with the physical world. It's a small look at the future of the connected world and why people like Larry Dignan, of our sister site ZDNet, have called the company out as being one of the most innovative tech companies today.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Tech News You Can Use newsletter.

    "title": "Amazon launches new cloud services to tackle data loss, analytics, migration",
    "text": "On Monday, company leaders from Amazon Web Services (AWS) took the stage at the AWS NY Summit to detail the firm's latest efforts in data protection, analysis, and migration.\n\nThe first of the core announcements was Amazon Macie, a new security tool that uses machine learning to identify the secure data that a customer is storing in AWS, and takes steps to protect it. \"Amazon Macie recognizes sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII) or intellectual property, and provides customers with dashboards and alerts that give visibility into how this data is being accessed or moved,\" a press release said.\n\nMacie works with data stored in Amazon's Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), but support for additional data stores is due later in 2017, the press release said. Macie can be enabled through the AWS Management Console, and its cost is determined by the amount of content that is classified as secure.\n\nSEE: Special report: The cloud v. data center decision (free PDF)\n\nThe goal of Macie, it seems, is to make the jobs of security professionals easier by automating many of the daily processing tasks associated with categorizing and protecting cloud data. Once a baseline is established among a customer's data, Macie looks for anomalies, and alerts users to any activity it deems suspicious.\n\nAnother new service, AWS Glue, could make it easier to analyze customer data as well. Glue is an extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that simplifies the processes for loading data into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), or other databases running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), so that the data can be further queried and analyzed, according to a press release.\n\nETL jobs in Glue can be created through the AWS Management Console. Customers tell Glue what data they want to target in AWS, and then Glue \"discovers the associated metadata (e.g. table definitions) and classifies it, generates ETL scripts for data transformation, and loads the transformed data into a destination data store, provisioning the infrastructure needed to complete the job,\" the release said.\n\nAWS Glue is a serverless solution. Because of this, customers are billed for compute resources consumed relative to data preparation and loading jobs, the release said.\n\nIn an effort to make cloud migration easier, AWS also announced its new AWS Migration Hub, an umbrella solution made up of the AWS Application Discovery Service, the AWS Server Migration Service, and the the AWS Database Migration Service. In addition to guiding users through the migration process, it also tracks the migration status as well.\n\nWhile the AWS Migration Hub is based in the US West (Oregon) Region, it can manage migrations that happen in any AWS region, the release said. There is no additional cost for the Hub, as users are just charged for the services that are a part of the hub.\n\nAdditional AWS products like the Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), AWS Config, and AWS CloudHSM all received some minor updates at the AWS NY Summit as well.\n\nThe 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers\n\nAmazon Macie is a new security tool that uses machine learning to identify sensitive cloud data, and takes extra steps to protect it. AWS Glue is an ETL service that makes it easier to migrate data to one of many AWS data stores so it can be analyzed and queried. The new AWS Migration Hub is a collection of AWS tools that guide a user through the cloud migration process and give insight along the way.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cloud Insights newsletter.

    "text": "The First Amendment gives Americans freedom of speech, however, it does not give citizens freedom from consequences of their speech, says tech author and BlogHer co-founder Elisa Camahort Page. Recently, a Google engineer was fired after releasing a controversial memo stating women don't advance in the tech industry because of biological differences. Page uses this issue to shed light on how companies can manage free expression in the workplace.\n\nSEE: Employee political activity policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nIn the situation of the Google memo, the employee was fired not because he broke a law, but because he broke a company policy.\n\n\"When people talk about having open discourse and people being able to be free to express their opinions, what they mean is about 'how to develop a product' or 'how to address company services,' Page said. \"They want to have alternative points of view around making the best possible product.\"\n\nThis freedom of expression in the workplace isn't an excuse to get into political debates, and most companies don't want you to do that, she said.\n\nIt also becomes a liability issue for a company when its employees make derogatory comments about their colleagues-especially in an environment where collaboration is critical-because it affects employees' comfort levels and deters the best talent.\n\nSEE: Hostile workplace prevention policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nPage suggested that companies of every size should have a code of conduct about internal and external communications. Companies need have policies in place about the type of speech that's appropriate for their employees about their colleagues. Employees should also know that they represent the company when talking about anything relevant to their industry.\n\n\"This should be normal for companies and employees to understand,\" she said.\n\nPage said that all companies with over 50 employees should have an HR manager.

    "title": "Cambridge Analytica's Facebook game in politics was just the beginning, the enterprise was next",
    "text": "Updated 3/18/2018: On March 17, 2018, Facebook announced that Cambridge Analytica was suspended for violating the company's standards and practices. TechRepublic's Dan Patterson was one of the early reporters to write about Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 campaign. Patterson spoke with CBS News about how the data firm could have harvested so many Facebook profiles. The interview has been added to this article.\n\nSEE: How a Facebook app scraped millions of people's personal data | Video: Facebook data was misused to sway 2016 voters, reports says (CBS News)\n\nThis article was originally published on March 13, 2017.\n\nTechRepublic recently reported on controversial tweets by former White House technology staffer Gerrit Lansing and former Trump campaign social media strategist Gary Coby alleging Cambridge Analytica overstated its role in the campaign and the capabilities of the firm's technology. Specifically the company was accused of taking credit for Trump's Facebook advertising strategy and his victories in Michigan and Florida.\n\nThe tweets sparked a fiery debate about the role of big data in politics and vertical industries. Big data undeniably played a huge role during the 2016 presidential campaign, and after big elections political data innovations are often adopted by enterprise companies and SMBs. Some political technology firms-particularly partisan startups like NGP VAN and Targeted Victory-are now focused on local and regional races in the US. Other firms, like L2 and Cambridge Analytica, deploy their analytics product across enterprise verticals such as media, finance, and health care.\n\nSEE: Quick glossary: Big data (Tech Pro Research)\n\nLast year in an interview with TechRepublic CEO Alexander Nix reiterated the company's non-partisan status. \"We are fundamentally politically agnostic and an apolitical organization,\" he said. \"The high volume of Republican primary candidates this cycle allowed us to enter a competitive market.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica famously states its database contains over 5,000 data points on nearly every American consumer. The company is hardly the only big data company to make grand assertions about the power of analytics. Nearly every firm that TechRepublic spoke with while reporting this story agreed that big data is undeniably powerful and expressed concern that \"magical\" claims undermine the true value of analytics.\n\nWATCH: Documentary shows information revolution of big data (CBS News)\n\n\"Faulty products that exaggerate results can mismanage client expectations,\" said a person familiar with the political technology industry. \"Innovation only really succeeds if the product works. In any [business] sector, if one company exaggerates it harms the entire ecosystem. It erodes trust in the market.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica refuted the allegations and clarified its role on the campaign in mid-February during a 30-minute phone conversation. Portions of the audio interview, however, were off record so we asked Cambridge Analytica's head of product, Matthew Oczkowski, to respond to the allegations and clarify how their technology works.\n\nCan you contextualize the controversy regarding the tweets from Lansing and Coby?\n\nAt CA, we break up our data into three buckets: political, commercial, and 1st party. We work with several of the main voter file providers, depending on the preference of our clients, to access vote history and voter profiles. We also access many of the top commercial data providers on a licensing basis; this data includes things like general demographics, geographics, purchase history, interests, etc. Finally, we collect data internally from R&D projects like internal surveys and research, exclusive data relationships, and data collection through direct response projects.\n\nCan you articulate what Cambridge Analytica's technology is, how it works, and how you applied your tech for the Trump campaign?\n\nAt our core, we are a data and behavioral science company. Simply put, we help organizations figure out who to talk to and what to say to them. We believe that demographic-based marketing has become relatively obsolete and that understanding the underlying motivations of an individual are a far more effective way to communicate with someone. We deploy this research through both digital and television, which serve as the vehicles to reach these individuals.\n\nFor the Trump campaign, we served as the data agency of record, but our role quickly evolved as the cycle progressed. Our three core pillars of execution were data science and analytics, digital marketing (mostly persuasion and GOTV), and polling/research. Having a large amount of control and input into each of these three areas allowed us to be extremely efficient and reactive. It also allowed us to easily integrate with the staff at Giles-Parscale and the RNC.\n\nOur approach allows our clients, like the Trump campaign, to more efficiently spend their resources and better persuade and mobilize their advocates.\n\nSince data is the underpinning of every actionable insight that an organization would want to make, the applications of what we do are endless. With the Trump campaign, we assisted with everything from resource allocation for media buys, calculating the most efficient candidate travel stops, influencing the content in surrogate speeches, and personalizing messaging to the individual voter.\n\nSEE: Hiring kit: Data architect (Tech Pro Research)\n\nWe learned that no two campaigns are alike and that there is no 'playbook' for the standard way to run a data, digital, or technology program on a campaign. Developing a custom program five months out from election day proved to have its unique challenges. Also, the style of President Trump as a candidate was far different from what we have seen with other candidates. This required us to changes some of our approaches to more quickly measure the attitudes of the electorate.\n\nHindsight is always 20/20, but going back and doing it all over again I would have traded money for time. I say this on most campaigns that I work on, but a bit more maturity in a few of the programs we set up may have yielded even better results. Given the outcome of the election, we are more than happy with the result.\n\nAt the end of the day, people are people. Convincing someone to show up and vote or donate for a political candidate is correlative with many issues businesses face everyday. Whether it be finding new customers, or improving brand loyalty, many of our techniques are suited to do just that.\n\nRegarding your tech, does the firm build tech in-house, acquire tech from startups and other companies, or a mixture?\n\nWe acquire data in a number of ways - everything from commercial licensing, political exchange agreements, internal investment (R&D projects), and proprietary relationships with partner companies.\n\nWe most certainly do build tech in house. We recently hired our CTO, Darren Bolding, who served as CTO of the RNC this past cycle. Darren and I manage, and are currently expanding, our in-house team of engineers to productize our offering a bit more. We aim to move more towards general automation of what we do in the form of a SaaS product.\n\nSEE: IT leader's guide to Agile development (Tech Pro Research)\n\nBig data is a huge business trend. What's your take on the current state of political big data? And what does the future look like?\n\nWe don't consider ourselves a 'big data' company, we are a data analytics company. Many organization out there want to serve as the database of record for their clients. We aim to be the layer on top of that, which provides our clients with actionable insights - essentially acting as the brain behind the decision-making process.\n\nWe've come a long way, but there is still a lot of work to be done on the side of automation. Campaigns move so quickly that often it's difficult to keep up. The more automation we can bring to the process outside of the campaign HQ will greatly increase our speed in delivering insights to the decision makers.\n\nKeep up to date on all of the latest in tech.

    "title": "Learn these 3 languages now if you want to become a data scientist",
    "text": "Looking to expand your skills in the tech realm? Demand for developers with data science skills is currently \"very strong\" among businesses, according to Shu Wu, director of Indeed Prime, with \"tremendous growth\" over the last four years for data scientist job postings.\n\n\"Job outlook is strong and data science roles command a high average salary, but the competition is tough,\" Wu said. \"A data scientist that is an expert at examining data is great, but someone who can make data digestible for the entire organization is pinnacle.\"\n\nTechnology advances and the massive volumes of online data available are affecting every sector and have tremendous impacts on the economy, said Karen Panetta, IEEE fellow and dean of graduate engineering at Tufts University. This so-called \"data avalanche\" is not just about the sheer volume of data, but also the speed at which it changes and grows, and the diverse types of data available.\n\n\"Knowing how to use a spreadsheet and a traditional database will not suffice in the emerging Big Data revolution,\" Panetta said. \"Analyses need to be done in real-time, where decisions can be critical. Being able to simply know how to use the software tools is only part of this challenge. Understanding the data across disciplines, being able to communicate its meaning, and using statistics will be the differentiating factors from a traditional 'number cruncher.'\"\n\nSEE: How to build a successful data scientist career (free PDF)\n\nIn terms of learning a programming language that allows you to work with data, \"the standard across the board for any language is to find something and do it,\" said Forrester analyst Mike Facemire. \"The great thing about writing code is that doing it wrong is a great learning experience.\" Facemire recommends going to Github to see examples, and finding a data set that interests you and learning to analyze it.\n\nUltimately, it's more important to understand how to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller pieces than it is to know the language itself, Facemire said. \"At the end of the day it's just a way to interface with a computer,\" he said. \"The computer doesn't care which language you use, it cares more that you broke down your problem properly and solved it properly to get the proper outcome.\"\n\nSome educational institutions have created data science degree programs, including Northeastern University, Boston University, CUNY and Merrimack College. Some of these schools offer online courses, and lower-cost programs and seminars are available through the IEEE Computer Society, Panetta said.\n\nIf you want to pursue a career in data science, you should consider learning one of the following three languages.\n\nR is a language and framework used for data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis, Panetta said.\n\nThe language saw a large surge as data analysis and data science become more prevalent in the past couple years, Facemire said. It's popularity has since leveled off a bit, however. R has tooling that is built for data scientists, with extensions and plugins specifically for that purpose.\n\n\"It is essential when learning a language like R that individuals understand the fundamental mathematical skills,\" Panetta said. \"It would be disastrous if we just trusted the outputs of software without knowing what we were truly measuring and without understanding the data we were providing it as input.\"\n\nSEE: The 10 easiest programming languages to learn\n\nPython is a general purpose language, which is already hardy, and includes tooling that can fit into environments that require visualizations that will appear in websites or on mobile, Facemire said. It is also more readable than R, he added.\n\n\"If you're at the point in my career when you're thinking, 'I want to be a data scientist-which language should I learn?' I would look at both R and Python and see which makes sense to you,\" Facemire said. \"Both are absolutely viable.\" Businesses usually don't prioritize one over the other in terms of required skills for data scientists, he added.\n\nJava was recently ranked as one of the most favored and most versatile language to write in, according to a survey from WP Engine. It's another general-purpose programming language that is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It can be used to build virtually anything, particularly scalable, multithreaded platforms, and has a strong user base.\n\nJava is also an interpreted language-unlike C and C++, Java doesn't require as much lower-level understanding of the hardware, Panetta said. That makes it easier for those studying in disciplines beyond computer science and engineering to learn it. Java is also the most in-demand coding language in terms of tech job postings, according to Indeed.\n\nKeep up to date on all of the latest trends in big data.

    "title": "Feeling uninspired? 4 tips for gaining fresh perspective on leadership and innovation",
    "text": "For decades, workers from line level to management aspired to be experts in their particular niche. If you were an IT leader at an automotive parts company, you'd strive to learn every nuance of the industry, attending industry conferences, hiring outside industry experts, and perhaps occasionally visiting the customers that used your components as a way to gain an additional perspective. However, new competitors, new technologies, and companies that are willing to abandon the \"rules of the road\" are changing the game.\n\nSavvy leaders are finding inspiration outside the walls of their company, and apply techniques from seemingly unrelated industries to their companies. Taking inspiration from unlikely places has a twofold benefit. First, it can allow you to identify tools or techniques that haven't yet been applied to your industry. Secondly, it can reignite a passion for your company or even your career more broadly. If you're feeling that there's little left to learn or inspire, taking an outside perspective provides an entirely new world of knowledge to excite and inspire you. Here are some ideas for gaining an outside perspective.\n\nToo many adults have lost the joy with which children explore their worlds, constantly asking why and trying to determine how something works. As leaders, we can apply this zeal inside and outside our offices. Despite years at an organization, give yourself permission to explore why certain things are designed a certain way, and to look for how that process could be improved, modified, or abandoned. Similarly, let your curiosity roam outside work, when you're shopping, traveling, or engaging in a hobby.\n\nGood design, interesting processes, and innovation are all around us, and an intriguing customer experience at your favorite store might serve as inspiration for everything from an employee training application to a story that helps sell your next internal initiative. Next time you're stuck in line, waiting for a meal, or in a waiting room at a doctor's office, put your phone away and just observe. How are people interacting? What technologies are being used or disused? How are employees interacting with their customers? What's interesting or noteworthy about the physical space? You'll suddenly find that there's inspiration all around you.\n\nSEE: How to keep your staff motivated and engaged (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\n2. Follow aspirational companies and industries\n\nRather than looking solely to industry peers or your customer base for inspiration, identify a few companies or industries that have capabilities that you'd like to acquire. Recently many companies have begun focusing on customer experience, and seek inspiration from the retail industry, a relatively obvious example of looking outside your industry.\n\nThere are also more nuanced examples. Perhaps your company sells plumbing supplies through a complex network of dealers and distributors. Automotive companies have long been faced with similarly complex distribution and dealership networks, yet must market directly to consumers, and may provide techniques and inspiration that haven't yet arrived in your industry. Apple has long been known for creating well-designed products, but they also run a world-class supply chain, with complex manufacturing and distribution relationships that could be relevant to any manufacturing company.\n\nEven business models can serve as an inspiration. Uber brought digital disintermediation to the masses, and being \"The Uber of [insert industry]\" has become a bit of a clich\u00e9, but it's still worth thinking through whether other business models could be applied to your company. Could you rent your products rather than selling them? Is there a physical product or a service offering that could augment what you currently sell? Could you serve as a middleman that allows entry into an otherwise expensive product? Other companies have proven that unconventional business models can be successful, so at the very least thinking through how these could apply to your industry will prepare you for potential competitors.\n\nAs leaders, we often fall into a default state of assuming our job is to provide answers. We're the men and women that are supposed to make decisions, provide guidance, and answer tough questions. These are important leadership skills, but increasingly, so is asking the right questions. The rapid pace of change increasingly means we as leaders simply cannot have a functional knowledge of every discipline that's required to compete effectively in today's market. A junior designer on our team might have a bit of knowledge that can help push the collective thinking forward, but will only offer that knowledge if you as a leader create an environment where he or she feels like they can contribute.\n\nTry to gain a sense of the perspectives each person on your team brings to the table. This is useful for two reasons. First, it allows you to call on specific people when you need expertise in a particular area. Secondly, it can help identify areas where your team is lacking. You may have a dozen technologists, but no one that can think through how to make employees more effective. Or, you might have a room full of great thinkers on customer experience, but no one that knows the capabilities and limitations of the tools required to deliver those experiences.\n\nSEE: 10 books every small business entrepreneur should read (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nFocusing only on your industry can be comfortable. You speak the same language, have the same concerns, and often move at a similar pace to industry peers and competitors. As a leader, you may have grown up in the industry, and are well-regarded as an expert in the space. It can be uncomfortable to spend time with someone who has never heard of you, and regards some aspect of your company as significantly lagging or even irrelevant. However, just as sitting in an \"echo chamber\" of like-minded individuals can adversely affect our personal lives and perspective on our fellow human beings, so, too, can safely remaining in your professional echo chamber.\n\nFor more business and leadership tips, subscribe to our Executive Briefing newsletter.

    "text": "An unusual Android bug found by a Reddit user is causing a lot of people to scratch their heads: When typing \"the1975..com\" (note the extra dot) the poster found all of his recent text messages displayed through Google instead of the content he was searching for.\n\nOther Reddit users chimed in saying that they were getting the same results, with some even experiencing it when they performed a search for \"Vizela viagens\" (a travel agency in one Reddit user's home town), and the glitch also appeared with variant spellings too.\n\nReddit users with a wide variety of Android devices said they were affected as well. Particularly interesting is one comment stating that if you type \"my text messages\" into the search bar you receive the same result. What this means for how Google may be caching text messages is unknown.\n\nGoogle has yet to issue a statement regarding the bug, and without some acknowledgement of the issue and its scope it's difficult to know if there is any real risk of data exposure.\n\nMore likely is the possibility that the bug is connected to Google Assistant, as pointed out by an article on MSPoweruser: \"upon testing, I found out that any Android device with Google Assistant has this issue. It isn't certain if this is a deliberate action by Google or just a weird glitch that [lets] Google access the messages stored on the device.\"\n\nSEE: Mobile device computing policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nGoogle Assistant has been able to read text messages aloud for some time, raising the distinct possibility that Google simply overlooked a few precise search terms that would generate the same result.\n\nThose concerned about the privacy and security of their text messages can protect themselves, and the process is easy. Open the Settings app, tap on the Apps option, and then revoke SMS permissions from the Google app.\n\nThere's a good chance this isn't anything more than a simple bug, but taking precautions to protect your personal messages is good to do just in case.\n\nAndroid users are reportedly finding their text messages in Google Search results when typing specific things like \"the1975..com\" or \"Vizela viagens.\" It's not known at this point if there is a security risk inherent in this glitch.\n\nIt's more likely that this is a bug tied to Google Assistant's ability to read text messages aloud. If you're still concerned about device security you can disable Google's SMS permissions in the Android Settings app.\n\nLearn about the latest exploits and bugs by subscribing to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

    "title": "Securing smart factories: How Schneider Electric connects devices and prevents outages",
    "text": "TechRepublic's Dan Patterson spoke with Andrew Bennett, the SVP of IoT EcoStruxure at Schneider Electric about EcoStruxure's role in the Internet of Things.\n\nWatch the video, or read the full transcript of their conversation below:\n\nPatterson: The Internet of Things has a profoundly powerful impact on the digital transformation of almost every industry. Andrew, thank you very much for your time today. I wonder if we could start with first, what is EcoStruxure, and what role does the Internet of Things play?\n\nBennett: Yeah, great, thank you, Dan. Schneider Electric of course, is a company that works with a lot of industrial clients, so you can think about us in industrial space and buildings, in the grid, and of course, what we do for places like data centers. And one of the things that we've been doing for a long time is thinking about connecting devices in those settings to enhance analytics. That's really kind of the core of what we do as a company. We take a very OT, operational technology perspective on that. And so EcoStruxure, EcoStruxure really is our set of architectures that allows us to think about all those connectable devices, and then edge control, how do you actually control those devices.\n\nA lot of our clients are running mission-critical operational technology, so this could be a nuclear power plant, or a petrochemical facility, or the grid. And so, edge control of those devices, actually having intelligence, not just embedded at the nodes but at the edge, is really important as they can't risk being disconnected from the internet.\n\nSEE: The Power of IoT and Big Data (Tech Pro Research)\n\nAnd then at the top of EcoStruxure, at the top of that stack, it starts with those connected devices and then edge control, really is where we build a lot of our software. So we build software for control, for analytics, of where we're starting to build out some of the AI and machine learning, and where we store a lot of that data of course, in the cloud, so that we start to do more sophisticated views of what's going on in those manufacturing sites, or petrochemical sties, or whatever they happen to be.\n\nAnd so that's, I would say at the crux of it, that's what EcoStruxure is. It's an architecture that allows all three of those layers to interoperate, and it's really designed to be completely open and interoperable, because while we think our customers should only buy Schneider Electric stuff, that is probably not realistic and so, we need to be very open in the way we work with other vendors as well.\n\nPatterson: I'm glad about the nuclear power plants, there are all types of industrial facilities that are adopting Internet of Things, but generally when I talk to people, even in business technology, they tend to think of IoT as a smart fridge or your Alexa. Can you give us an example of a device that might be IoT and deployed at large scale?\n\nBennett: Yeah, for sure. I think, think about just a breaker. Just your electrical infrastructure, and really the most important thing, because it's pretty hard to run a manufacturing process or a plant without power. And so today, because of really our heritage and our legacy with power, and delivering clean reliable energy, everything starts with that electrical infrastructure. So at plants today we have customers that are connecting those assets. They want to know about their energy consumption. They of course want to reduce energy consumption 'cause that's good to the bottom line.\n\nIt's also good from a sustainability perspective. So if you think about all that electrical infrastructure, then you can start to kind of work your way up the stack in terms of whether it's a motor that's running a conveyor belt, or part of your process. Whether it's a pump. These are all devices that historically were not all connected, right. They didn't historically see the need to necessarily connect those. Over time, more and more of those devices became connected, primarily so that those companies could control.\n\nSo when we talk about OT, as juxtaposed to IT for a second, we're really talking about operational technology where a SCADA, which is the software for controlling that infrastructure, is actually opening and closing devices. It could be a breaker, it could be a pump, and what's happened over time is, of course that data is hugely valuable to start to think about broader trends. And so a lot of times we talk about this IT/OT convergence, which probably gets a little overplayed out there, but that's really those two worlds, right, where you're taking all these connected devices from an OT perspective, and starting to think about all the fantastic things you can do with IT from an AI, machine learning, and all the great things that are coming out there in the industry.\n\nPatterson: You said the magic words there. What role does automation and artificial intelligence play with this connected infrastructure?\n\nSEE: Green tech initiatives: Best practices and breakthroughs (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nBennett: Yeah, listen I think there's an endless set of applications in the IoT and industrial space of the Internet of Things. You know I also think we have to be careful, because I do think there's a tendency and I'm certainly guilty of it, of using a lot of the buzzwords and attracting folks to the pure machine learning side of the equation. But what we're observing with clients today, is first of all, a lot of them are still moving through that journey of actually connecting to those devices, right? Controlling those devices. So kind of the, I would say the ability to actually aggregate data.\n\nBut what's happening over time for sure is, as you aggregate that data, as you can start to look at broader trends, you could start to bring in things like machine learning, and the thing that I think that we're seeing today that is the most pronounced, is that you still need quite a bit of human interaction when it comes to machine learning or AI. You need to identify patterns, and then you need to feed those back into machine learning so that you know what that pattern recognition looks like, and then you can start to take proactive measures, and so, just one example.\n\nYou know a lot of outages or problems that happen in industrial setting, often start, you can actually look at things like partial discharge, or electrical partial discharge that happens in equipment. And if that happens over a long period of time, eventually that piece of equipment's probably going to fail. And so today, if you kind of looked at the signatures of what that looks like, a human being can look at that, you know we have thousands of electrical engineers in our company. Incredibly intelligent about what they do. You might not necessarily want to go out drinking with them but, they're a lot of fun too, to actually identify these problems. These guys can look at that, they can look at those signatures, they can instantly say, \"You're going to have a problem here.\"\n\nNow to codify that, and actually take that and build AI around that, that process is, I would say we're in the early stages. So you saying this, this is what that pattern looks like, now you can feed that into an AI system, and you can start to create a set of patterns that you can look for, and then obviously do what we ultimately wanna do, which is not just predict, but avoid outages and equipment failures in an industrial setting.\n\nPatterson: Andrew, last question for you, what about the security? All of us adopting Internet of Things, see security as an integral component of the entire infrastructure. What role does cybersecurity and cyber defense play in adoption of IoT devices?\n\nBennett: Yeah look, the software, the hardware that we deliver for our clients, you know we are working with folks that are driving mission critical OT out there in the industry. So that's the good news. The bad news is that those clients are always gonna be targets, you know really aggressive nation state type attacks, not just your run of the mill hacker.\n\nSo for us, as a company, when you kind of go back to thinking about EcoStruxure and those three stacks, I think the important thing is to think, not just about how well hardened is that connected product, 'cause some of them aren't. They weren't historically, they were just maybe a thermometer, right, and so you wouldn't think about how you had to protect just a little device.\n\nBut you have to think about cybersecurity comprehensively across that entire stack. Not just the products, not just the edge control, but the software layer at the top. So, for us as a company, that's really our approach to think about all three of those aspects of EcoStruxure, how we not just bring new devices and add new IO to that environment, but how we think about cybersecurity from the product design level all the way up to that top stack of software, so, it's a big challenge, and you know we take it pretty seriously as a company, as you can imagine.\n\nFor more about IoT and other tech innovations, subscribe to our Next Big Thing newsletter.

    "title": "How to develop a business case for your project",
    "text": "A business case is the first step in gaining approval for a project. Regardless of how small a project may seem, it is important to take the time to consider why the project is worthy of time and finding resources.. This may seem like an unnecessary and time-consuming step, but it can increase the chances of getting a project approved.\n\nIn short, a business case is a comprehensive document created by the initiator of a project that details and justifies the business need for the project and why it should go ahead. The business case is reviewed by key decision makers who will determine if a project will be approved and allowed to proceed or denied. The following is a list of everything a business case should include.\n\nSEE: Quick glossary: Project management (Tech Pro Research)\n\nThis is a brief high-level description and summary of what is in the business plan. It makes it easy for executives and other key decision-makers to quickly understand what to expect in the document and is used to capture their interest.\n\nA statement of the problem or opportunity\n\nThis section of the business case helps decision makers understand what the opportunity or issue is and why they should be interested in reading further about the proposed project. Projects are typically initiated to:\n\nDeliver a product or service based on the request of a customer\n\nAddress a legal, legislative, tax, security, or other type of governance requirement.\n\nAn analysis of the problem or opportunity\n\nIn this section, you should present your analysis of why the problem exists or how an opportunity came about. It should also identify any risks to the business or department if the project does not go ahead. Make sure to include facts as well as support for those facts that affirm the need behind the project proposal.\n\nThe business case should identify the potential solutions. These should be clear and realistic. In this section, include not only the solution(s) but also information that describes how and why these are considered solutions.\n\nTo make an informed decision, executives need to know all-in costs as well as the benefits of a project to the business. They will also want to know the tangible and intangible costs to the organization if the project does not proceed. As with the problem and opportunity analysis section, make sure to include facts that support any claims or assumptions.\n\nSEE: IT project cost/benefit calculator (Tech Pro Research)\n\nThis is the section where you provide your recommendation regarding the solution you are proposing and why. Support your recommendation with facts and figures whenever possible. Also explain why this solution is better than other possibilities.\n\nThe project proposal section outlines key information about the actual project such as the scope, the timeline, the costs, and resources required to successfully execute the project.\n\nBusiness cases can differ in length and composition depending on the size, nature, or complexity of a project or organization. The key is to ensure that you have factored in at least these five things:\n\nWhy a project is needed. What prompted the need for the project. What resources and funding are required. How the project will be implemented. What the final impact or benefit is to the organization.\n\nOnce the business case is approved, the information from it will be transferred to another key project management document called the project charter where it will be expanded upon further.\n\nFor more project management and leadership advice, subscribe to our Executive Briefing newsletter.

    "title": "How to add Google Docs to the Windows 10 New section of the context menu",
    "text": "In early 2018, I received an email from a TechRepublic member asking me to revise and update an article I wrote back in 2012. In Add Google Docs to the Windows 7 New menu (revised), I showed how to add various links to Google Docs to the New section of the Windows 7 context menu. It was a complicated hack of the Windows Registry and not something anyone should undertake lightly.\n\nSince receiving that email, we have been exploring other options users can take to add easy access to Google Docs to Microsoft Windows 10. The simplest and most efficient way is to add links to the Chrome jump list located on the Taskbar as explained in How to create new Google Docs using jump lists in the Microsoft Windows 10 taskbar.\n\nSEE: Comparison chart: Enterprise collaboration tools (Tech Pro Research)\n\nHowever, despite showing you an easier way, and despite the warnings, some of you will still want to use the method that involves hacking the Windows 10 Registry file. Here are the steps you can take to add links to the Windows context menu (Figure A) that will allow you to start a new Google Doc, Spreadsheet, Presentation, or Drawing.\n\nWARNING! This technique involves the edit of the Windows 10 Registry file. The Registry is vital to the operation of the Windows operating system. A corrupted Registry could render Windows inoperable and require a complete re-installation to repair. Backup the Registry and create a System Restore point before you attempt this technique.\n\nSEE: Windows 10 power tips: Secret shortcuts to your favorite settings (Tech Pro Research)\n\nThe total amount of editing to be done to the Windows Registry with this technique is too great and too rife with the possibility of error to list in this article. Instead, to simplify the process, I have created a downloadable file that you can use to do the edit for you. Click the link below to download the file and then extract its contents into an empty folder.\n\nThe file was originally created by HowToGeek for Windows 7 but has been modified to reflect changes made by Google over the years. That is the other major drawback of this technique, besides editing the Windows Registry, Google could change the links to create new documents at any time, which would break this hack and require another revision.\n\nThe folder with the extracted files should look like Figure B. Copy the four icon files to the Windows folder so the system can find them. Next, run the AddGoogleDocsToNewMenu.reg file by double-clicking it. The system will warn you about editing the Registry file, click OK and let the edit take place.\n\nIt may take a few seconds for the change to finish processing, but the next time you right-click on an empty spot on the Windows Desktop and navigate to the New menu item you should see four new entries, as shown in Figure C.\n\nThis edit is specific to the free version of the Google productivity suite. Subscribers often use Google Docs from within a domain structure. In this situation, the AddGoogleDocsToNewMenu.reg file must be changed to reflect the domain. Links to each type of document will have to be modified to look like this:\n\nRight-click on the AddGoogleDocsToNewMenu.reg file and open it with Notepad or some other text editor. Do not just double-click it or select Open-that will just run the file with the wrong links. Change the links of each section to reflect your domain and then save the file.\n\nIf you want to remove the links from the New item list of the Windows context menu, double-click and run the other file located in the download called: UninstallGoogleNewMenu.reg. This file will eliminate the keys created by the other file and revert the New menu back to its default settings.\n\nSEE: How to create new Google Docs using jump lists in the Microsoft Windows 10 taskbar (TechRepublic)\n\nThis technique should work for any version of Windows 10 and as long as Google maintains the current file reference system. However, it is the more dangerous option. Adding links to the Taskbar makes more sense, particularly in an enterprise environment, where IT departments frown severely on users editing the Windows Registry.\n\nKeep up with Microsoft news, product releases, and feature updates.

    "title": "Mary Meeker's 2018 internet trends report: 5 things business pros need to know",
    "text": "On Wednesday, KPCB partner Mary Meeker released her 2018 Internet Trends report-a 294-slide presentation examining the global impact of the internet on the economy, and how it is changing the daily lives of users.\n\nWhile the report is focused heavily on the consumer side of tech, there are some key trends that impact the business world. Technology companies represent 25% of the overall US market cap, and that number is growing, as noted on slide 39. Additionally, six of the top 15 CapEx and R&D spenders in the US are tech companies, the report found.\n\nAs technology continues to impact the US and world economies, certain aspects of the field will be especially important for business professionals to keep up with. Here are five of the most important things in Meeker's report for professionals to take note of.\n\nSEE: IT leader's guide to achieving digital transformation (Tech Pro Research)\n\n1. Internet is impacting, disrupting jobs\n\nTechnology disruption is nothing new in the workplace, but the pace at which it is happening is accelerating, as noted on slide 142 of the report. The rapid adoption of the internet coupled with massive growth in storage and compute power is rapidly shifting day-to-day work in every industry.\n\nTechnology also makes it easier for freelance workers to find jobs, and freelance work is growing at a faster pace than traditional work. On-demand workers are in high demand, and are growing in number. Immigration is also essential for creating new tech jobs, as 56% of the highest-valued tech firms were founded by first or second generation Americans, as noted on slide 289.\n\nWhile this may sound like a broken record, customers keep moving to mobile, and they don't seem to be slowing down. Mobile shopping and mobile payment apps are providing better online and in-store experiences, and many services-including mobile app-based ones- are shifting from one-time purchases to subscription models. Mobile shopping apps alone have experience 6% year-over-year growth, the report noted. The next generation of retail includes mobile technology and in-store retail, furthering the omnichannel ideal some companies are striving for.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) platforms are growing in prominence, brought to light by cloud leaders such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This includes hardware tools for GPU acceleration, and APIs for features such as natural language processing and computer vision.\n\nBased on a Morgan Stanley CIO survey cited in Meeker's report, AI isn't an enormous priority for increased spend, but it is \"rapidly rising.\" Meeker quoted Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who said that \"AI is one of the most important things that humanity is working on.\" The US and China are the two biggest players in AI right now, according to the report.\n\nOne of the most poignant points that Meeker noted was the rise of the \"privacy paradox,\" wherein internet giants are using personal data to make services better and cheaper, increasing both user engagement and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nFollowing the Cambridge Analytica controversy at Facebook and the advent of GDPR, companies have to walk a fine line between personalizing their products and services and remaining in good favor with consumers, watchdog groups, and regulators. Companies must understand the unintended consequences of their products, and regulators must understand the unintended consequences of regulations, Meeker said in the report.\n\n5. Enterprise messaging improves productivity, collaboration\n\nConsumerization has reshaped what enterprises expect from their tech tools, with Dropbox and Slack being two of the best examples, Meeker noted in the report.\n\nOne particular aspect of consumer products that is also exploding in the enterprise is messaging threads. These threads help organize information and the teams that need it, while also providing context and history, Meeker's report said. Tools like Slack can shorten the onboarding process, eliminate many email conversations, and help development teams get to market faster than before.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Executive Briefing newsletter.

    "title": "'Unpatchable' Nintendo Switch exploit is perfect example of the importance of firmware security",
    "text": "Building a slide deck, pitch, or presentation? Here are the big takeaways:\n\nAn unpatchable flaw in Nvidia Tegra X1 SoCs makes it possible for an attacker to gain control over a device to run arbitrary code.\n\nThe flaw applies to all Tegra X1 SoCs and can't be fixed-Tegra X1 bootROMs can't be patched once they leave the factory.\n\nA vulnerability in Nvidia Tegra X1 system on a chip (SoC) processors allows an attacker total control over the device at the bootROM level, and there's nothing Nvidia or Tegra X1 hardware manufacturers can do about it.\n\nThe exploit, called Fus\u00e9e Gel\u00e9e by its discoverers Kate Temkin and ReSwitch, has already been used to install a custom ROM on a Nintendo Switch.\n\nNintendo's tablet-like Switch runs on a Tegra X1, as do other Android tablets, making this vulnerability concerning to any manufacturer who builds systems on the X1, and even those building on other Tegra chips, Temkin said. The nature of the attack makes a software patch impossible, and Temkin recommends anyone with an affected device should move on to a new one when possible.\n\nThe Fus\u00e9e Gel\u00e9e vulnerability requires gaining access to the Tegra X1's USB recovery mode, which has an inherent flaw that allows an improperly coded USB control request to overflow the bootROM's direct memory access (DMA) buffer.\n\nSeveral requests that can be sent to the bootROM are improperly coded: A proper request would only return the amount of bytes the handler has available, but some return however many bytes a host requests.\n\nThat coding error allows a host to request up to 65,535 bytes, more than enough to overflow the DMA buffer. Once overflowed, an attacker can copy data into the protected application stack and execute any code they desire.\n\nThe most obvious solution to Fus\u00e9e Gel\u00e9e would be to issue a software patch to fix the bootROM, but here's where a problem arises: bootROM patches on Tegra X1 chips are impossible once a chip leaves the factory.\n\nIpatches, which are patches released at the factory during chip production, would be able to fix the flaw on X1 devices that haven't left the assembly line yet, but anyone who has a current Tegra X1 device is vulnerable to a Fus\u00e9e Gel\u00e9e exploit.\n\nAn important warning about hardware and firmware security\n\nThere are several lessons to be taken away from the Fus\u00e9e Gel\u00e9e exploit, and they apply to OEMs as well IT professionals.\n\nFirst off, manufacturers need to be sure that their hardware has been properly tested against all possible attacks. Fus\u00e9e Gel\u00e9e allows a device owner to hack their own hardware, which isn't a risk itself, but it could also allow an attacker to write code to remotely execute a similar attack.\n\nFirmware security is a critical part of device design that can easily be exploited-just look at Spectre and Meltdown. Had Intel been diligent in seeking out vulnerabilities, it might not be facing a vulnerability in nearly every single processor it ever created.\n\nSEE: IT leader's guide to reducing insider security threats (Tech Pro Research)\n\nFor IT support staff and security professionals, Fus\u00e9e Gel\u00e9e paints a whole other set of complications: hardware security.\n\nIn the case of the Nintendo Switch, hardware modification was necessary to force the device to boot into recovery mode. Doing so isn't complicated though: It just requires the bending of an exposed pin.\n\nIt's not known what kind of hardware exploits may be necessary to force other Tegra X1 devices into recovery mode, but it's best not to find out and to implement good hardware security policies instead. Publicly accessible devices should be protected from tampering by putting them in locked cases or in secure mounts.\n\nFrom a security perspective, Tegra X1 devices should be closely monitored to make sure they aren't on a business network while in a modified state. While the risk of problems from a rooted device is minimal, they still open up possible attack avenues that may not be expected.\n\nGet the latest security news by subscribing to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

    "title": "How to find and interview nontraditional tech job candidates: Tips for managers",
    "text": "The tech talent shortage is requiring many companies to think outside the box when it comes to finding employees to fill tech roles. This means looking beyond standard computer science graduates and expanding your search pool to include some nontraditional candidates, including those for whom tech is a second career, those with disabilities, and those from a variety of unrelated backgrounds.\n\n\"There are more positions open seeking computer science degrees than there are computer science degree graduates right now,\" said Blake Angove, director of technology services at LaSalle Network. \"So if you want to get your position filled in a timely manner and get the work done, you have to look at more nontraditional degrees.\"\n\nOften, other degrees include skills that can relate to IT roles, Angove said. For example, LaSalle Network recently placed an IT project manager with a history degree at a company. \"They had strong writing skills, they had analytical skills, so those relate well to a project management position,\" he said. \"So even though it's a technical role, the person is doing well on the job.\"\n\nHere are some tips for finding and interviewing candidates who could make a difference at your company.\n\nSEE: Interviewing guidelines policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nFinding a candidate who can do the job often means rewriting job descriptions, said Mel Hennigan, talent expertise panelist for the Society for Human Resource Management.\n\n\"When you start to reverse engineer the position and you can base the requirements on what outcomes you need to achieve, you start to realize you can broaden your pool,\" Hennigan said. \"You no longer have to say, 'You must have this degree to qualify for this position.' Instead, it's 'You must meet these objectives,' and that opens the spectrum up a lot.\"\n\nMany companies require a bachelor's degree for every position, even administrative ones, Hennigan said. \"You should really break it down into what tasks have to be performed in order to achieve success, and then let the best candidate win based on their skills and abilities rather than on their credentials,\" she added.\n\nFor positions such as programmers, it's easy to set up an online test that allows you to objectively judge whether or not they have the abilities to complete the job. \"A recruiter no longer has to pick up the phone for the initial screen, when a recruiting tool can provide the candidate with a set of questions that will help qualify them or disqualify them, and it can do so based on their actual abilities rather than their credentials,\" Hennigan said.\n\nBudgeting for training to catch nontraditional employees up to speed will also allow you to make faster hires, and eventually make your company more competitive, Angove said. \"We're finding companies that are fortunate enough to have that budget to provide training or certification are loosening up some of the specific technical requirements and ramping the people up,\" he added. Building a mentor program is also a successful and cost-effective way to help new employees learn more tech skills, Angove said.\n\nCandidates build skills in many ways, all of which should be taken into consideration, said Kelli Jordan, IBM's talent leader for New Collar Initiatives. \"They can build it in a four-year degree program. They can build it in a computer science program at a community college, or in a boot camp,\" she said. \"What we like to focus on is that application of the skill, and a lot of that does come out in the interview process.\"\n\nIBM performs skills assessments for job candidates, regardless of their background. For example, when interviewing for a software development role, interviewers give candidates a coding exercise, examine their GitHub repository, and talk to them about the code they wrote.\n\nSEE: How CXOs can develop a diverse workforce (Tech Pro Research)\n\nThe interview process for all job candidates includes behavioral questions about what a candidate has done previously, such as \"Tell me about a situation where you had to evaluate competing priorities.\" It also includes situational questions, which tend to work well for candidates with minimal experience, Jordan said. These are questions such as, \"Walk me through how you might handle an upset client.\"\n\n\"That's going to help you to understand that candidate's thought process and their potential future behaviors, and together, they help you build a really good picture,\" Jordan said.\n\nIt's key to listen for a nontraditional candidate's intent, Jordan said. This person may have some great examples of how they have handled a situation in the past, but they may have applied that knowledge in a different way or setting. \"Focus on the skill and the application of what they've done versus where they did it,\" she added.\n\nTo attract more diverse candidates, Microsoft undertook a number of inclusivity measures in recent years, including reworking job descriptions and training managers on interviewing nontraditional candidates, according to Neil Barnett, the company's director of inclusive hiring.\n\nAbout two and a half years ago, Microsoft created an autism hiring program. Some 50 employees have been hired through the program, Barnett said. About half of those employees had applied to jobs at Microsoft previously, he added.\n\nBut now, \"we train managers and teams ahead of time on neurodiversity and disability etiquette,\" Barnett said. \"We believe that by demystifying and breaking down the stereotypes of disabilities, we can help eliminate any unconscious biases that recruiters, hiring managers and teams might have before they interview a candidate.\"\n\nMicrosoft also trains hiring managers to offer job candidates the opportunity to ask and receive customizations for the interview. This might include performing a technical interview on their own familiar device, spacing more time between multiple interviews, or lengthening the time of each interview-which might allow someone with ADHD or a cognitive disability adequate time to think and respond to questions.\n\n\"Managers found that offering customizations have made all interviews more successful,\" Barnett said. \"Asking candidates what they need to have the most inclusive interview experience will pay off in finding untapped talent.\"\n\nKeep up to date on all of the latest leadership news.

    "title": "How to install Android's Via Browser and why you should use it",
    "text": "Ah the ubiquitous web browser. What would we do without one? Not much, that's for sure. No matter if you're seated at your desk or roaming about with mobile in hand, you depend upon a web browser. But which browser? That's the key. There are browsers for every type of user, especially in the mobile landscape. Most users, however, simply live with the default. On Android, that's Chrome. What would you say if I told you there were better options?\n\nThere's Firefox, Opera, Puffin, Dolphin, Naked Browser, Orfox, Ghostery, and so many more. But one particular mobile browser tends to fall through the cracks. That browser is Via Browser, and it is certainly worth your time. Via Browser is a lightweight, fast, customizable, mini browser that doesn't feel like a \"mini\" browser at all. In fact, outside of the fast speeds, Via contains enough features to make it feel like its full-blown brothers and sisters. Via is also really stable, with a developer that actively works to fix bugs and add new features.\n\nLet's install Via Browser on Android and see if it might make you want to switch from your default.\n\nThe installation of Via Browser is quite simple. Here are the necessary steps:\n\nOpen the Google Play Store on your Android device Search for Via Browser Locate and tap the entry by Lakor Tap Install Allow the installation to complete\n\nThat's all there is to the installation. At this point, you should see an icon for Via on the home screen or the App Drawer (or both). Tap to launch the browser.\n\nOut of the gate, you'll be warned about the necessary permissions. The developer has done a great job of explaining these permissions (so users won't grow paranoid that the browser is spying on them in any way - Figure A).\n\nDismiss this warning and then okay the necessary permissions (Storage and Location).\n\nUsing Via Browser is incredibly intuitive. From the homepage (Figure B) tap the search bar and either type a search string or a URL. If you type a search string, the results will appear in a Google search. If you type a URL, guess what? The site in question will appear. Simple.\n\nIf you don't want Google as your search provider, you can tap the Menu button (three horizontal bar icon in the bottom right of the Via homepage) and tap Settings. Tap General and scroll down until you see Search Engine. Tap Search Engine and select from the available options (Figure C).\n\nOne option I like with the default Chrome browser is the pull down to refresh gesture. Fortunately, Via includes this-only it's not enabled by default. To enable this option, go to Settings | General | Operation. In this screen (Figure D), tap to enable the Pull to Refresh Gesture.\n\nOut of the box, Via Browser has Do Not Track and Block Ads enabled and Location Access disabled. There is also an included Incognito Mode, for use when you want to leave nothing to chance. To get to the Incognito Mode, tap the Menu button and then tap Incognito Mode (Figure E).\n\nI have to admit, I really like how the Via Browser handles tabs. At the bottom of the window, you'll see a small square with a number. That number is now many tabs you have open. Tap that square to reveal a popup that allows you to quickly access any of those open tabs (Figure F).\n\nClosing an open tab is just a matter of tapping its associated X.\n\nOf all the mobile web browsers I've used, Via offers the best ratio of speed, options, and simplicity. Are there better browsers? Sure. On the desktop, Firefox is my go-to, but not so much on my mobile devices. When I'm on the go, I need fast, simple, and lightweight. That's Via Browser to a tee. If you've yet to find that perfect mobile browser, I highly suggest you give Via a try and see if it doesn't wind up your default.\n\nAutomatically sign up for TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise Newsletter for more news and tips.

    "text": "Autonomous transportation has been a subject of science fiction for decades, but it's quickly becoming reality, with companies such as Ford and Domino's Pizza being some of the latest to get into the action in interesting new ways. This month's special report from ZDNet and TechRepublic, Tech and the Future of Transportation, looks at how the rise of autonomous transportation will affect businesses and employees.\n\nYou can download all of the stories as a free PDF ebook (free registration required).\n\nThere are many obstacles to overcome before autonomous vehicles go mainstream, and writer Conner Forrest examined those, including liability in case of accidents, insurance coverage, and fear caused by high-profile mishaps.\n\nDiving further into the safety issue, writer Teena Maddox reported on the ability of autonomous vehicles to save lives by eliminating accidents caused by human error.\n\nLooking at the current business landscape, writer Alison DeNisco reported on research that named the 10 leading companies in the autonomous vehicle space. Some relatively unknown companies made the list, and some of the usual suspects like Tesla, Uber, and Apple were absent.\n\nTechRepublic's global editor in chief Jason Hiner delved into the massive disruptions that could be unleashed by hyperloop.\n\nThis feature also contains original research from Tech Pro Research, a joint venture from ZDNet and TechRepublic. That report details predictions from 289 professionals about how autonomous transportation will affect their industries, companies, and personal lives.\n\nTo read these articles and more, download the full PDF report, Tech and the Future of Transportation.\n\nFor more about autonomous transportation and other innovations, subscribe to our Next Big Thing newsletter.

    "title": "How to use the Windows Tags property to manage Office files",
    "text": "Sometimes you don't know you need a feature until you discover it and put it to use for a bit. Then you wonder how you ever got your work done without it! That's how you might feel about Windows Tags. Yes, it's a Windows feature, but you can use Tags to manage Office files-and other file types as well. Whether you work alone or share files via a server or even OneDrive for Business, you can benefit from Tags. In this article, I'll show you how to add Tags to Office and non-Office files and how to search using those Tags.\n\nI'm working with Office 2016 (desktop) on a Windows 10 64-bit system. The Windows Tags property is available in older versions, back to Windows Vista. In Office, they've been available since at least Office 2007 (but maybe longer). There's no downloadable demonstration file. You won't need one.\n\nDon't confuse Office Smart Tags and Windows Tags; they aren't the same thing. Windows Tags are keywords used for organizing (searching) files. How you use them will depend on your needs, but anytime you're working with bulk files or sharing files for the same purpose, Tags can help. Don't limit their use to simply describing the file's contents, either. You can use Tags to describe how you use the file. For instance, you might use terms such as complete and not complete to describe status. Or you might use the term upload to group files you need to upload to an external service such as OneDrive.\n\nTags are a Windows file property, but you can add them when saving an Office file. During the save process, you'll see an Options link. It's quite possible that you've never explored this link before. Let's take a look:\n\nWith any Office file open, click the File tab and choose Save As in the left pane. Below the Filename and Location controls, click the More Options link (Figure A). In the bottom-right corner of the resulting dialog, look for the Tags control (Figure B). Click the Add A Tag Link and supply a keyword (Figure C). To add more than one, separate the keywords with a semicolon. Once you add a Tags keyword, Office will display it in an AutoComplete list when you tag subsequent files, making it easier to use Tags consistently. Click Save and continue as you normally would.\n\nClick the Tags control and start entering keywords.\n\nYou can add Tags to all your Office files this way. Although I showed you only one, you might have several files that warrant a plant sale or 2018 keyword. Following our example, you have a plant list in Excel, but you might also have a vendor contract in Word and several graphic files you're using in different publicity venues.\n\nNow let's use File Explorer to find all your plant sale files. You could run a quick search on your local drive using any number of search strings: plant list, contract, and so on. If you use this route, you know that a search can take a while and it often turns up a lot of files you're not looking for. As you can see in Figure D, what you might expect to be a simple search for your Word contract is anything but. A similar search on 2018 could return similar or even worse results.\n\nA search on contract returns a lot of files.\n\nOkay, I confess: The above search is unnecessarily complicated-I did that on purpose. If you see a lot of files you can't identify, check the Advanced Options dropdown and make sure System Files is unchecked (unless you're looking for system files). Doing so will improve most search tasks, with or without Tags.\n\nHowever, thanks to Tags, you don't have to second guess, remember every related file you've generated or updated, or wade through busy search results. Even if the search includes system files (as above), you won't see a lot of unexpected files. You'll see only the files you've tagged accordingly.\n\nTo pinpoint just the files you want to see related to your plant sale, open File Explorer and click This PC (or a folder, a server drive, or OneDrive). Enter a search string in the following form:\n\nAs you can see in Figure E, the search on Tags: plant sale matches only two files: the plant list in Excel and the vendor contract in Word. If you know where the files are, you can run a quicker search by selecting that folder before executing the search. If you're like me, some folders contain a lot of files and a Tags search is often easier and quicker than a normal alphabetical list.\n\nUsing the plant sale Tags keyword reduces the number of files returned.\n\nNot all software allows you to add Tags when saving a file, but that's not a problem. You can use File Explorer to add Tags:\n\nOpen File Explorer and select the file you want to tag. On the View tab, click Details in the Panes group to open the Details pane. Enter the appropriate Tags (Figure F). Click Save.\n\nNow when you run the same search, Tags: plant sale, File Explorer returns the first two files and the .jpg, as shown in Figure G.\n\nThis time, the search found three tagged files.\n\nUsing File Explorer, you can sort and group a folder's contents using Tags. Simply click the View tab and choose Tags from the Sort By or Group By dropdown. Or right-click the background and choose Tags from the Sort By or Group By options. In addition, you can filter for Tags. As Figure H shows, you can filter for specific Tags if you're using the Details view. This is great when you know all your files are in the same folder.\n\nUsing File Explorer, you can add Tags to several files at the same time. Hold down the Ctrl key while selecting files to create a multi-file selection. Then, add Tags as you normally would. If you add a file to the selection that doesn't allow tagging, the Tags control won't be accessible for any of the files, so be careful.\n\nTags, or keywords, are only as good as the people adding them. If you work alone, this is easy. If you're trying to corral files for an organization, it's much harder. Everyone may not be on the same page, so searches will be incomplete at best. That might be one reason they're not more popular. Even using File Explorer, you can't add Tags to every file type. For instance, you can't tag a .txt file.\n\nIn addition, you can use any of the properties via the Details pane in the same way. For instance, for Content status, you might enter Incomplete and Complete. To search, you'd use the string Contentstatus: Complete. You can also use wildcards. To see all tagged files, you'd enter Tags: -[]. That means that where Tags isn't null. As you can see, there's a lot to explore!\n\nGet more great Office tips and tricks delivered to your inbox.

    "title": "How to work with a personal coach to improve your leadership skills",
    "text": "Often, individuals begin their management careers by being thrust into management roles after they demonstrate outstanding operational performance. Unfortunately, few companies prepare these new managers for management responsibilities. Worse yet, a crisis in leadership can become a personal trauma.\n\n\"I hate my job,\" said a manager-colleague last week as we were having coffee. \"All I ever wanted to do was develop software, and now my company's asking me to manage it.\"\n\nThere are many individual like this in tech. Entrepreneurs innovate new products and then just as zealously set out to find a CEO or COO to run their companies. In other cases, individuals who are managing really do want to become the great managers that their companies expect them to be-but they are afraid of failing.\n\nSEE: How to manage job stress: An IT leader's guide (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nIf you're operating in a management capacity, but find yourself needing coaching and mentoring, you may want to consider engaging a personal coach. Here are a few tips for doing so:\n\nOne of the reasons managers pursue career and personal coaching is that they feel something is missing from their management styles and techniques, but they don't know what. A personal management coach can help you identify shortcomings in your management style and how to address them-but it's still good to have some idea of what your shortfalls might be before you engage an outside coach to help you. Having an idea of what you think the problems are is a great way to starting the conversation.\n\nSeek measurable and results-oriented coaching\n\nManager coaching shouldn't be used just to make you feel better about your job - it should be intended to actually improve your performance and effectiveness. If your coach doesn't have a results-oriented methodology for coaching you, you will want look at other options.\n\nOne of the more established management coaching methods is goals-reality-options-will, or GROW.\n\nGROW was first developed in the UK in the 1980s. In the process, the person being coached develops goals that they would like to attain, and identifies the obstacles that have prevented attainment. In step two, the person and coach look at the realities of the situation. In step three, the person works with a coach to discover options, such as what would happen if the obstacles didn't exist, or what else they could do, and in step four a specific goal attainment plan with timelines is developed.\n\nPursue your coaching in a trusted environment\n\nI once worked alongside a vice president colleague who told me she asked the CEO for assertiveness training. She had many great ideas, was frequently drowned out in meetings, and it was beneficial for her and the company that she get the training. Unfortunately, she also ended up reinforcing her boss' opinions of her non-assertiveness by asking for the training.\n\nIf you are in a situation like this, it might be more advantageous for you to invest on your own in a career coach.\n\nSEE: How to build a successful CIO career (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nManagement consultant Peter Drucker once said, \"Efficiency is doing the thing right. Effectiveness is doing the right thing.\"\n\nTo get there, managers pursue coaching in areas that range from developing self-confidence in meetings and in interactions with others, to learning how to better balance their personal and professional lives.\n\nBy engaging with a personal coach, managers can attain better results-and that's good news for companies and employees, too.\n\nFor more business and leadership advice, subscribe to our Executive Briefing newsletter.

    "text": "If you're after a computer close to the size of the tiny Raspberry Pi but approaching the power of the MacBook, then you may want to check out the LattePanda Alpha.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting the LattePanda Alpha is not a Pi competitor. While the Pi costs just $35, the LattePanda Alpha starts at $289.\n\nThe difference is reflected in the specs, with the LattePanda Alpha having more in common with a laptop than a low-cost board like the Pi.\n\nThe LattePanda Alpha uses the same class of Intel processor as found in this year's 12-inch MacBook, a 7th generation, Intel Core m3.\n\nBacking up this processor is 8GB of DDR3 memory and 64GB Flash storage, alongside Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11ac Wi-Fi and USB 3.0 ports, a USB Type-C port, 4K video out.\n\nWhile the board's makers DFRobot say the Alpha will ship with Windows 10 Pro, they add it will also be compatible with a range of Linux-based OSes.\n\nThe board-which is about 70% the length of the iPhone 7 Plus-is designed to be used to be used by developers working in a wide range of fields, from robotics to internet of things, and as such has the necessary electronics for adding a wide-range of custom hardware to the board.\n\nSEE: Hardware spotlight: The Raspberry Pi\n\nThe Alpha has 2 x 50-Pin headers for hooking up hardware, as well as an Arduino Leonardo co-processor.\n\nAlongside the Alpha, the board's makers will also release a version of the board without the eMMC storage for $269, as well as the lower-specced LattePanda Delta, which starts at $129.\n\nThe Delta runs on an Intel Celeron N4100 processor, has 4GB of RAM but still keeps many of the advantages of the Alpha board, such as 802.11ac Wi-Fi and 3 x USB 3.0 ports.\n\nBoth boards are being crowdfunded via Kickstarter, and as of publication have passed their \u00a372,611 funding target, with just shy of \u00a397,000 raised with 56 days left to go.\n\nDFRobot estimate that the boards, which are also available with a 7-inch touchscreen display, will ship in May next year.\n\nIt is not the first Windows 10-based, developer board released by the company, with an earlier machine selling for around $120. That initial board was again higher specced and priced than the Pi, but also attracted some reports that the board overheated without additional cooling, resulting in the processor being throttled to a slower speed.\n\nAutomatically sign up for TechRepublic's Open Source Weekly Newsletter for more hot tips and tricks.

    "title": "Storage survey aims to shed light on reading data in 100 years",
    "text": "A decade ago, the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) conducted a 250-person survey to gather information about how companies might read data from 2007 when the year 2107 arrives, but it's become so obsolete that the words flash and cloud aren't even found in the 66-page concluding report (PDF).\n\nIf at first you don't succeed, try again, SNIA officials determined.\n\n\"It took us quite a while to put the first survey together 10 years ago. We got a lot of good information from it,\" said Thomas Rivera, chairman of the SNIA data protection committee. \"We realized that as time went on there's been a lot of changing in the industry, not just in storage itself but also in a lot of the technology and regulations regarding storage and archiving.\"\n\nSEE: Cloud Data Storage Policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nSNIA has many updates in the 2017 edition of its survey-there are 50 questions about business drivers, data sources, organization goals, policies, preservation, privacy, security, and storage. They hope to double the amount of respondents and include archivists, record managers, and technologists (the 2007 edition focused on technology managers). Also, there's a strong emphasis on leaving the storage questions open ended and not mentioning specific brands, so that a vendor cannot easily rig results, Rivera said.\n\nThere are already storage companies today that claim 100-year reliability based on laboratory endurance tests, Rivera noted, though he acknowledged that such claims are impossible to truly prove short of owning a DeLorean equipped with a flux capacitor.\n\nSEE: The cloud v. data center decision, free PDF (ZDNet/TechRepublic special report)\n\nSome of the unique questions from the current survey are:\n\nWhat is your organization doing to deal with media migration and long term readability issues? (Migration means periodically moving information to new media to assure readability. Readability refers to both physical and logical readability-is the information in a format that your applications can read and interpret?)\n\nWhich applications produce information that is of highest concern in maintaining long term readability of information? (Readability implies the ability to read the physical media and to logically interpret and use the content in an application context.)\n\nDo you audit/verify the integrity of data stored by a managed service provider or cloud? Yes/No? How?\n\nDo long-term archives necessitate the use of specialized security technologies and/or services that differ from normal storage infrastructure? If yes, what are they?\n\nSNIA hopes to publish results in the first half of 2018. Rivera added that future surveys may be even more frequent than every 10 years based on technology changes. Looking forward, he observed, the next edition could include questions about DNA storage, persistent memory, and quantum computing.\n\nKeep up with news about data centers, enterprise storage, and networking-subscribe to our Data Center Trends newsletter.

Jasper RCMP members responded and headed east but almost immediately after received a report of a two-vehicle collision.\n\n\"A male suspect had exited his vehicle and was yelling at bystanders and attempting to fight them,\" Const. Patrick Vallee said in a press release. \"The suspect then got back into his vehicle and fled the accident scene.\"\n\nHe pulled over a short distance west of the scene at a spot known as disaster point and according to bystanders, started loading what looked like a gun, hiding behind his vehicle. Many of the members of the public likewise took cover behind their own vehicles.\n\nTwo Jasper RCMP officers conducted a \"high-risk arrest\" and took the suspect into custody without incident. He was transported to hospital to be treated for non-life threatening injuries he sustained in the collision.\n\n\"The RCMP would like to thank the public for its assistance during and after this incident,\" Vallee said.\n\nPercy was found to be in possession of more than one firearm, triggering a host of Criminal Code, traffic, drug and National Parks Act charges including impaired operation, dangerous operation, failing to remain, possession of a controlled substance and unsafe storage of a firearm.\n\nThe complete list of charges is below.

    "text": "Trump went on the counter-offensive as his administration reeled from the abrupt dismissal of Michael Flynn as national security adviser on Monday.\n\nThe New York Times reported late on Tuesday that phone call records and intercepted calls showed members of Trump's presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the Nov. 8 election.\n\nTrump dismissed the report, firing back in a series of early morning tweets on Wednesday.\n\n\"This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign,\" the Republican president tweeted, citing his former Democratic rival in the 2016 presidential contest.\n\nIn another tweet, Trump said: \"Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia,\" adding that the situation was \"very serious.\"\n\n\"The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by \"intelligence\" like candy. Very un-American!\" Trump wrote.\n\nHe did not give evidence to back his charge that intelligence officials were supplying information to the news media. He did not say if he had ordered any investigation into leaks.\n\nReuters could not immediately confirm the Times report, which the Kremlin dismissed on Wednesday.\n\nCNN also reported that Trump advisers were in constant contact with Russian officials during the campaign.\n\nThe Times, citing current and former U.S. officials, said U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time they discovered Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThe officials had seen no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election, the Times said, but they were still alarmed by the intercepted communications.\n\nFlynn was forced out over conversations he had with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office on Jan. 20, and his misrepresentations to Vice President Mike Pence over what he had discussed.\n\nThe Times said the intercepted calls in its report were different from the wiretapped conversations between Flynn and the ambassador, Sergei Kislyak.\n\nU.S. lawmakers, including some leading Republicans, called on Tuesday for a deeper inquiry into not just Flynn's actions but broader White House ties to Russia. Trump has long said that he would like improved relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFlynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador took place around the time that then-President Barack Obama imposed new sanctions on Russia on Dec. 29, charging that Moscow had used cyber attacks to try to influence the presidential election in Trump's favor.\n\nA U.S. official familiar with the transcripts of the calls with the ambassador said Flynn indicated that if Russia did not retaliate, that could smooth the way toward a broader discussion of improving U.S.-Russian relations once Trump took power.\n\nThis was potentially illegal under a law barring unauthorized private citizens from interfering in disputes the United States has with other countries.",

    "title": "Safer tomorrow, thanks to Safer Tomorrows",
    "text": "Starting in 2011, the effort was awarded more than $3 million in grants, the bulk of that from a competitive U.S. Department of Justice grant program.\n\nThe program's four lead partners-Grand Forks, the Grand Forks School District, Lutheran Social Services and the Community Violence Intervention Center-used the money to support extensive bullying and sexual-assault prevention programs, therapy services for child victims and character-building efforts such as the Coaching Boys into Men program.\n\nOver time, Safer Tomorrows activities were offered in every public school and three parochial schools in Grand Forks County.\n\nThe federal grant support ran out last month. So, Safer Tomorrows leaders now are reporting back to the county about what the program accomplished and what efforts might be sustained into the future.\n\nIn December, some of the leaders spoke to the Herald editorial board. A transcript of the conversation is below; it has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nQ. Did Safer Tomorrows start with the grant that you won in Washington several years ago?\n\nPete Haga, Grand Forks community/government relations officer: Yes. Since 2012, Safer Tomorrows has received a total of $3.3 million to work toward ending or mitigating childhood exposure to violence in Grand Forks County.\n\nWe're now sunsetting on the federal grant, but we're sunrising on our efforts to sustain the program into the future.\n\nQ. What was the background for the project?\n\nKristi Hall-Jiran, executive director, Community Violence Intervention Center: I don't know if you're familiar with the Adverse Childhood Experiences study. We call it ACE for short. Basically, it was a study that was done some years ago that looked at kids who had experienced trauma during childhood.\n\nThe things that are counted as ACEs are things like seeing violence in the home, having a parent die, going through a divorce, being a victim of child abuse.\n\nSo, what the study showed was that besides higher rates of depression and anxiety, there was a very high correlation between the ACEs and physical ailments as well, including things like cancer, heart disease, diabetes.\n\nFor example, if kids have four or more ACEs, they actually start having neurochemical changes in their brains. And what that can lead to is three times the rate of academic failure, seven times the rate of alcoholism, 12 times the rate of suicide attempts.\n\nSo those are very depressing outcomes. Add in all the health effects as well, and it gets to be pretty overwhelming.\n\nBut what the national research also shows is that if we can mitigate trauma at a much earlier age and get people the help and intervention they need, we can really prevent a lot of those long-term health effects from happening to a huge population of people.\n\nSo, that's why we really wanted to focus on helping kids and changing things in the long term. And of course that has a huge economic value as well, when you look at what we spend on juvenile delinquency programs and health care costs and psychological services costs, all of those things that are impacted down the road.\n\nI think we've kind of worked through that part, and now we're focused on, OK, that's a terrible outcome, but there are so many things that can make a difference along the way.\n\nAnd since the program began, we've heard amazing stories about how coaches can make a difference, how teachers can make a difference. If the parents aren't able to be present in a child's life, who else can step up?\n\nQ. What kind of programs did you offer that helped bring about your results?\n\nHall-Jiran: At CVIC and elsewhere, we were involved in the actual counseling and intervention piece. We knew that the awareness-building and school-based efforts would lead to huge referrals, which they did. We saw a 213 percent increase in the number of kids that we served over that time, and we helped nearly 1,000 children through the trauma.\n\nAnd so, some of the results we're seeing, 96 percent of kids that go through our programming have an increase in their coping skills and their emotional well-being. That's going to lead to better grades at school, and is reflected in a lot of the results that we've been finding.\n\nJanell Regimbal, vice president of children and family services at Lutheran Social Services: At the school level, the programming goes from that preschool age with our Al's Pals program-which is helping those younger kids know how to deal with conflict, to respect and understand differences, to regulate their own emotions better-all the way up to the high school.\n\nAnd in the high schools-to use just one example-we're involved with the Fourth R. That's a curriculum that looks beyond reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic to the fourth R, which is relationships. It helps kids understand how to form and treat relationships. It's an evidence-based curriculum that the health teachers are able to take and infuse into what they're already doing.\n\nSo that's a unique aspect. It's not just middle school or elementary school, but that entire span of childhood and adolescence, such an important time in the growth and development of kids.\n\nJody Thompson, assistant superintendent for Grand Forks Public Schools: Pete referred to the sunsetting and the sunrising. The sunrise part of the plan is that we've had multiple staff members who've been trained nationally in the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program, a research-based and nationally proven model that involves surveys, curriculum and training.\n\nAnd Olweus is one that has just blended perfectly with our character-education themes and what we would do normally.\n\nWe're big on the sustainability. Thanks to Safer Tomorrows, we were the recipients of some outstanding training and curriculum expertise. As a school district, we don't take that very lightly, because we haven't had to pay for anything.\n\nThat's a significant benefit to us. But we also want to make sure that this continues to be a part of our culture.\n\nQ. Does most of the instruction happen in a classroom setting?\n\nThompson: At the elementary level, we have character assemblies every month. So, that's something we've been doing for many years, but we integrate a lot more of this in those events.\n\nThere are schoolwide expectations for how to behave in the Grand Forks Public Schools. A lot of it is based on Olweus. You walk through our buildings and see posters about what the expectations are-above the line, below the line behaviors; and that's just become a standard. And it doesn't matter if you're a custodian or a worker in the lunchroom; everyone knows what the expectations are for students. So, if someone is a custodian at Phoenix Elementary School and sees students misbehaving, he or she is trained to intervene and not have to send them to the office. That person can just get them straightened up right then and there.\n\nWe've empowered all of our staff to intervene if it's necessary.\n\nHall-Jiran: We're trying to look at changing the culture in the schools, instead of just having it be a lesson.\n\nOne of my favorite stories is about a lunch lady who saw something happening and was on her way to intervene at a table, but by the time she got there, the students' peers had already intervened. That's when we know it's really working.\n\nRegimbal: The proactive part is helping those \"bystanders\" become \"upstanders\" and to have empathy. Hopefully, these practices and discussions have helped build empathy with the kids, so they can put themselves in someone else's shoes and think, how can I support that person whom I saw that happen to? How can I be an upstander?\n\nCoaching Boys into Men is one of those real \"upstander\" pieces.\n\nQ. Tell us about Coaching Boys into Men.\n\nHall-Jiran: CVIC was the lead agency on that, and so we were able to hire (former Grand Forks Central football coach) Mike Berg, who most people know, as our coach specialist. He says he's retired from that role, but he's still a pretty awesome mentor to the coaches involved.\n\nSo he was able to be the supervisor to the coaches who are involved in this particular program. Basically, it's coaches talking to athletes about respectful behavior. They integrate it right into their practice sessions.\n\nAnybody who's had adolescent children at home know that many times, they will listen to their coaches like they listen to no one else. Whatever their parent or teacher is saying, it can take on a different meaning if it's something that comes from the coach: \"Well, this is how we treat women and girls, and it's OK to talk about it and have a healthy conversation about it.\"\n\nWe've reached more than 800 male athletes.\n\nHall-Jiran: A new project update on Safer Tomorrows shows really exciting outcomes.\n\nForty-six percent fewer students in grades 9-12 have reported that someone forced them to do something sexual that they did not want to do.\n\nViolence-related suspensions and expulsions are down 42 percent. Physical fights in schools, down 24 percent. Those are pretty awesome numbers.\n\nQ. Were these findings based on before-and-after surveys?\n\nHall-Jiran: Right. We used a lot of the surveys that were already done in the school system, and then compared the results as the project progressed.\n\nWe also in Grand Forks region have the lowest levels of dating violence at 33 percent lower than the rest of the state. And that's since the project started; before it started, we were actually higher than the rest of the state.\n\nHaga: The brain science of all this is fascinating. It is a touchy-feely method, but it's also a scientific truth that something is happening to the brains of our children when trauma is happening. And there are methods that we can use, if we know what to do and what to look for, that can heal those harms and actually change their brain science and actually prepare them even better.\n\nHall-Jiran: And that changes generations. As you know, when someone has unresolved trauma and then they parent, there's no way it doesn't affect their kids. So it just goes on and on.\n\nI see that at CVIC, and I'm sad, because i think we should have been there for those kids 25 years ago the way we are now.",

    "text": "After stumbling across a promotional vehicle that has grown well beyond its initial sentimental appeal into a marketing colossus, the NHL has regularly staged outdoor games since 2008, from snowy Buffalo to balmy Los Angeles.\n\nWhat started as a one off novelty has become the league's regular season centerpiece, a New Year's day extravaganza that has become the NHL's signature event.\n\nAfter the first Winter Classic in Buffalo the league was hesitant to even confirm there would be a second one.\n\nNow 21 games later, the NHL will tell you the outdoor showcases are here to stay.\n\nThe Centennial Classic, won 5-4 by Toronto, marked the start of the NHL's 100th birthday celebrations and the outdoor game is a firm part of the league's future.\n\n\"This will be the 21st outdoor game, so they are here to stay,\" Steve Mayer, NHL executive vice-president, chief content officer told Reuters. \"We all have to figure out the balance of how many.\n\n\"There are some years where there have been six and some years when there are three.\n\n\"There is a bit of a balance that we cannot do too many of these because we don't want to make it feel like it is not special.\"\n\nThe appeal of the outdoor game lies in the sport's roots, anchored by romantic nostalgia and wintery charm.\n\nBut after nearly a decade of taking it outside the NHL is looking at ways to keep the romance alive.\n\nGames have been played in iconic sporting shrines like Chicago's Wrigley Field and Boston's Fenway Park.\n\nThere have been exotic settings such as Dodgers Stadium in Los Angeles and marquee matchups featuring the NHL's biggest draws, Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin.\n\nIn 2014, the Maple Leafs and Red Wings faced off in front of a record crowd of over 105,000 at Michigan Stadium but for their Centennial launch the league chose a more intimate setting with 40,148 filling BMO Field.\n\nWhat better way to get a year-long party started than outdoors in the city many consider hockey's biggest market.\n\n\"We always talked about the greatest thing about these outdoor games is that they take you back to being a kid whether you did it in the backyard or pond or lake or a frozen river,\" explained Hall of Famer and all-time scoring leader Wayne Gretzky.\n\n\"Some of the kids in our era, we played on outdoor rinks. We had elite games that were on rinks outdoors.\n\n\"That's what this brings back. Parents come to these games with their kids and they think about when they were kids.\"\n\nHockey fans are being served a big helping of hockey nostalgia to start 2017.\n\nThe Centennial Classic will be followed on Monday, Jan. 2, with the Winter Classic in St. Louis, where the Blues will face off against the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nThe highlight of the NHL centennial, which will bridge this season and next, will come near the end of 2017 with the 100th anniversary of the founding of the league on Nov. 26 followed by the Dec. 19 anniversary of the first games.\n\nIn a bid to keep outdoor games fresh, Mayer says nothing is off the table, not even ruling out the possibility of taking the extravaganza to Europe sometime in the future.\n\n\"We are looking at all options and from the commissioner on down discuss what is the next best game, what's the next best place and how will it be unique,\" said Mayer.\n\n\"We are looking at all options, all places. I don't think there isn't any place we wouldn't go.\"",

    "text": "Bitcoin - a web-based \"cryptocurrency\" that has no central authority, relying instead on thousands of computers across the world that validate transactions and add new bitcoins to the system - jumped 2.5 percent to $1,022 on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange, its highest since December 2013.\n\nThough the digital currency has historically been highly volatile - a tenfold increase in its value in two months in late 2013 took it to above $1,100, before a hack on the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange saw it plunge to under $400 in the following weeks - it has in the past two years been more stable.\n\nIts biggest daily moves in 2016 were around 10 percent, still very volatile compared with fiat currencies, but markedly lower than the trading of 2013, which saw daily price swings of as much as 40 percent.\n\nBitcoin may have been boosted in the past year by increased demand in China on the back of a 7 percent annual fall in the value of the yuan in 2016, the Chinese currency's weakest showing in over 20 years. Data shows most bitcoin trading is done in China.\n\nBitcoin is used to move money across the globe quickly and anonymously and does not fall under the purview of any authority, making it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls, such as China's.\n\nIt is also may appeal to those worried about a lack of supply of cash, such as in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed high-denomination bank notes from circulation in November.\n\n\"The growing war on cash, and capital controls, is making bitcoin look like a viable, if high risk, alternative,\" said Paul Gordon, a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association and co-founder of Quantave, a firm seeking to make it easier for institutional investors to access digital currency exchanges.\n\nThough bitcoin is still some way off the all-time high of $1,163 that it reached on the Bitstamp exchange in late 2013, there are now more bitcoins in circulation - 12.5 are added to the system every 10 minutes. Its total worth is at a record-high above $16 billion, putting its value at around the same as that of an average FTSE 100 company.",

    "text": "Duluth police responded to a 911 call reporting shots fired at 510 E. 11th Street at about 2 p.m. Tuesday. The victim was taken from the home on a gurney, witnesses said, and transferred by Gold Cross Ambulance to a local hospital. Police confirmed just before 5 p.m. that the victim had died.\n\nPolice remained on the scene into the evening hours, and at 8 p.m. Duluth police reported that its officers - as well as several agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives - were executing search warrants in connection with the case.\n\nA \"person of interest\" had been detained but no arrests had been made as of 8 p.m., Duluth police said, with the investigation expected to continue overnight.\n\nMayor Emily Larson said in a statement Tuesday night that she wanted to assure the Duluth community that the police department is \"fully engaged\" and has responded swiftly to make progress to resolve the case.\n\n\"When a person is harmed in our community, our whole community is harmed. Today, tragically so. Our condolences go to the victim's family and friends. As a parent, this is simply heartbreaking news,\" she said in the statement.\n\nDuluth Police Chief Mike Tusken said that preliminary information indicated that the incident may have been related to a home invasion or robbery.\n\nThe shooting took place in a small, single-story house that neighbors said has been college rental property for several years.\n\nEleventh Street is a dead-end in that area, just off Central Entrance, below Skyline Parkway and two blocks west of Myers-Wilkins Elementary School. School district officials said the school was placed in a precautionary lockdown on request of police after the shooting. School was already out by that time but some students still were in the building for extracurricular activities.\n\nMore than 20 squad cars converged at the scene within minutes of the first 911 call, with many officers searching backyards, alleys and woods with their guns drawn. Several dogs also were used to search for a suspect outside the home.\n\nAgents from the U.S. Border Patrol and Minnesota State Patrol also were at the scene.\n\nResidents interviewed during the incident said the neighborhood has mostly avoided serious violence.\n\n\"I've lived here since 1958 and we've never had anything like this before. We've had some car break-ins, but no shooting before,\" said Ken Cusick, who lives just down the block and across the street from the house where the shooting took place.\n\nKlay Longstreet said he's lived on 11th Street for nearly 20 years.\n\n\"We have a lot of rentals on this block, so there are parties, the usual college stuff, but nothing serious,\" he said.\n\nTheresa Wanless said she lives just two blocks from the shooting. She said she still trusts law enforcement to find the guilty parties and keep control of the city's streets.\n\n\"But it's just two blocks from the school. And there have been lots of shootings. It's very scary,\" she said.\n\nWanless said she's not convinced that the shootings are unrelated or that city officials are correct saying it's not part of a larger problem.\n\n\"Now, after this, being so close to my home, I'm not so sure,\" she said, lamenting the lack of information released after each shooting.\n\n\"It's unfortunate we only get short answers\" from police, she said.\n\nThe case would mark the first homicide in Duluth since October, when 47-year-old Eric Wayne Burns was fatally shot outside a Lincoln Park bar. Aaron Demetrius Humphreys, 42, has been charged with intentional second-degree murder in that case.\n\nIt's also the second shooting death in the Twin Ports this year. Kyle Androsky, 21, was killed outside a Superior bar on the morning of Jan. 1, with his brother also suffering a gunshot wound. Authorities have issued an arrest warrant for 25-year-old Jamar Maurice Smith, who remains in custody in Minnesota, but have not charged him or anyone else with the actual shooting.\n\nTuesday's shooting is the sixth in Duluth in less than four weeks. Victims have suffered varying levels of injuries, but until Tuesday's shooting no deaths had been reported.\n\nPolice have said the incidents are an \"anomaly,\" brought on by a number of factors, including increased availability of firearms, but have said there are no clear connections between any of the incidents.\n\n\"We haven't seen a spike of shootings like this in my career,\" said Tusken, who has been with the department for 25 years, shortly after Tuesday's incident was reported.",

    "title": "Republican Anne Neu wins special election for Minnesota House seat",
    "text": "Neu beat DFL candidate Laurie Warner by 6 percentage points in the Valentine's Day election, carrying 53 percent of the vote to Warner's 47 percent. It was the first Republican-held seat up for election since Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.\n\nOrdinarily, Neu would have been heavily favored to win - Trump took about 60 percent of the district's vote in November. But with special elections often unpredictable, Republicans didn't take anything for granted.\n\n\"I'm grateful to Chisago County residents for their support and trust to be their new voice in the legislature,\" Neu said in an emailed statement. \"I'm eager to roll up my sleeves and get to work with my House colleagues working to make health care more affordable, cut taxes for families, and build a budget that respects Minnesota taxpayers.\"\n\nNeu's victory gives Republicans a 20-seat majority in the Minnesota House, their second-largest in the modern era.\n\nNeu's victory marks a step out into the limelight for a woman who has long worked behind the scenes on political campaigns.\n\n\"I never really saw myself on this side of an election,\" said Neu, a Republican activist and campaign worker. \"When this opportunity came ... I thought, it's time. It's time for me to do this in a different way, to step up and try to be an advocate for the people of Chisago County and for conservative values.\"\n\nShe says she'll focus on cutting taxes and trying to improve Minnesota's individual health insurance market, where premiums have soared in recent years.\n\nBy winning, Neu beat Warner in her second bid for the District 32B seat. A former Duluth City Council member before moving to North Branch a decade ago, Warner's top campaign issue was increasing school funding.\n\nBoth candidates raised and spent more than $25,000 on their campaigns, according to reports filed with the state Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board. Most of their spending went to mail sent to voters' homes.\n\nTuesday's election came about because of an unusual situation. Just two months before the November 2016 general election, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that incumbent Rep. Bob Barrett didn't live in the district and was ineligible to run.\n\nBecause the decision came so close to the election, there wasn't enough time under state law to replace Barrett on the ballot. Instead, the Supreme Court ruled that the November election wouldn't count for District 32B. The seat would remain vacant until February.\n\nDistrict 32B has been comfortably Republican in recent elections. Barrett beat Warner by 10 points in 2014. In both 2014 and 2016, other Republican candidates up and down the ballot won by similar margins. But it's not impossible for Democrats to win there in a favorable environment: In 2012, Barrett squeaked out a victory by fewer than 2 percentage points, and DFL Sen. Amy Klobuchar won in a landslide.\n\nTuesday's special election saw about 25 percent of the district's registered voters vote - much lower than the November election, when about 70 percent of registered voters in the district cast ballots.\n\nThat lower turnout is normal for special elections, since they take place at unusual times of the year and don't coincide with higher-profile state and national races. This can make special elections less predictable than normal races.\n\nBut Tuesday's race wasn't a normal special election. Because it was technically a continuation of the November election, people who voted early or absentee in November were automatically sent ballots for Tuesday.\n\nSo 25 percent of District 32B voters was actually much higher than the turnout in a pair of special elections last February, when between 10 percent and 20 percent of voters cast ballots.",

    "text": "U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time they were discovering evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee, three of the officials said, according to the Times.\n\nThe intelligence agencies then sought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election, the newspaper said.\n\nThe officials interviewed in recent weeks said they had seen no evidence of such cooperation so far, it said.\n\nHowever, the intercepts alarmed U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies, in part because of the amount of contact that was occurring while Trump was speaking glowingly about Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe intercepted calls are different from the wiretapped conversations last year between Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, and Sergei I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, the Times said.\n\nDuring those calls, the two men discussed sanctions that the Obama administration imposed on Russia in December. Flynn misled the White House about those calls and was asked to resign on Monday night.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment on the Times story.\n\nThe Times reported that the officials said the intercepted communications were not limited to Trump campaign officials, and included other Trump associates.\n\nOn the Russian side, the contacts also included members of the Russian government outside the intelligence services, the officials told the Times. All of the current and former officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the continuing investigation is classified, the newspaper reported.\n\nThe officials said one of the advisers picked up on the calls was Paul Manafort, who was Trump's campaign chairman for several months last year and had worked as a political consultant in Russia and Ukraine, the Times said. The officials declined to identify the other Trump associates on the calls.\n\nManafort, who has not been charged with any crimes, dismissed the accounts of the U.S. officials in a telephone interview with the Times on Tuesday.\n\nSeveral of Trump's associates, like Manafort, have done business in Russia. It is not unusual for U.S. businessmen to come in contact with foreign intelligence officials, sometimes unwittingly, in countries like Russia and Ukraine, where the spy services are deeply embedded in society, according to the Times.\n\nLaw enforcement officials did not say to what extent the contacts may have been about business, the Times said.\n\nOfficials would not disclose many details, including what was discussed on the calls, which Russian intelligence officials were on the calls, and how many of Trump's advisers were talking to the Russians. It is also unclear whether the conversations had anything to do with Trump himself, the Times said.",

    "title": "Editorial: North Dakota's efficiency/access tradeoff hinders Grand Forks",
    "text": "Omdahl's column is a terrific complement to Herald staff writer Sam Easter's story from last week, \"Great debates: Grand Forks history shows division over big projects\" (Page A1, Dec. 29).\n\nAs Easter documents, Grand Forks has long had a tough time getting to \"Yes\" on big projects such as the library. \"It seems - it's just this perception - when you go to other communities, they seem to do much better,\" City Council member Ken Vein says in the story.\n\nBut Grand Forks residents shouldn't feel too bad, because North Dakotans as a whole tend to share this resistance to change. That's because \"North Dakotans like access, even when it means throwing efficiency under the bus,\" Omdahl writes.\n\n\"People want a role-a big role-in government. Having many points at which citizens can be a part of government implements the cultural idea that everybody is important and should 'have a say.'\"\n\nThere's no better analysis of the stop-and-go process that has held up development of Grand Forks' Arbor Park.\n\nBut what about Fargo? For that matter, what about Bismarck?\n\nIn both cities, access-loving North Dakotans have mustered the efficiency to get projects done. In 2004, Fargo voters passed an 18-month, half-cent sales tax to build a new downtown library and two branch libraries with 62 percent of the vote.\n\nAnd in Bismarck, the Chamber of Commerce and a steering committee recently raised $8 million to renovate the Community Bowl, in part to keep the 1990s-era facility's status as host of the state high-school track meet.\n\nIt's always hard to compare communities, because it's so easy to selectively choose examples to make a point. And whenever Grand Forks frets about Fargo or Bismarck, it should remember City Council President Dana Sande's perceptive comment in Easter's story:\n\n\"My opinion is that people (in Grand Forks) are generally happy. And when you're generally happy, your tendency is to vote no for change.\"\n\nBut even contented populations can learn from other communities, especially where big and expensive projects are concerned.\n\nFurthermore, Grand Forks' sense that Fargo, in particular, has a stronger efficiency mindset goes back not just years but decades. Where development is concerned, \"Fargo means business and Grand Forks means hassles,\" a Grand Forks City Council member said in a Herald story on the subject in 2003.\n\nGrand Forks' policies strike us as being much friendlier to growth than they were then. Now, it's our hope that Grand Forks' determination will follow suit-that the city and its people will follow the Grand Forks Park District's lead, in mapping out an ambitious project (as the district did with Choice Health & Fitness) and finding ways to get it done.",

    "text": "Gibson stopped all 37 shots he faced as Minnesota peppered the Ducks net in all three periods, but was shut out at home for just the second time this season. Joseph Cramarossa had the lone goal for the Ducks (30-18-10), while Gibson recorded his fourth shutout of the season.\n\nThe Wild (37-13-6) had won their previous two meetings of the season vs. Anaheim, but fell behind early and were frustrated by Gibson throughout. Minnesota failed to score on five power plays in the game, coming within an inch of scoring when a long-range slap shot by defenseman Christian Folin hit the inside of the right post, sailed through the crease and to the side boards.\n\nMinnesota goalie Devan Dubnyk had 22 saves in the loss.\n\nThe Ducks took a lead less than five minutes into the game when Cramarossa went hard to the net and was rewarded. Streaking down the right side, Corey Perry took a sharp angle shot that Dubnyk stopped, but produced a rebound he couldn't control. Cramarossa, who'd gotten to the top of the crease, slapped the loose puck home before the goalie could react. It was Cramarossa's first goal in more than a month.\n\nMinnesota had the first two power plays of the game and out-shot Anaheim 13-8 in the opening period, but could not solve Gibson.\n\nThe Wild got two more power plays in the second period, and were thoroughly dominant throughout, out-shooting the Ducks 16-4. But Gibson repeatedly thwarted the Minnesota scoring chances.\n\nIt was the first shutout in more than a month for Gibson, who blanked Dallas on Jan. 10, and the win allowed Anaheim to close its six-game road trip with a 2-3-1 mark.\n\nAnaheim lost top-line left winger Antoine Vermette with 12:27 to play in the third period after he was ejected for slashing linesman Shandor Alphonso.\n\nNOTES: The Wild assigned F Tyler Graovac to Iowa of the American Hockey League after he cleared waivers. In 45 games with the NHL club this season, he has six goals. With his 6-foot-5 frame, there was some thought that he might be claimed by another team this close to the trade deadline but instead headed back to the minors. ... Ducks RW Jared Boll was a healthy scratch for the fourth time in Anaheim's last seven games. He has two assists in 38 games this season. ... Minnesota, which is in the midst of a franchise-record eight-game homestand, will next host the Dallas Stars on Thursday. Anaheim, which wrapped up a five-game trip on Tuesday, hosts the Florida Panthers on Friday. ... There was some speculation that Ducks D Sami Vatanen could return to the lineup after missing the previous four games with a lower-body injury, but he was scratched again.",

    "text": "The event marked the 60th anniversary of the landing of the Granma yacht which brought the Castro brothers and their bearded rebels from Mexico to Cuba to start their revolution against a U.S.-backed dictatorship.\n\nTroops wielding automatic rifles marched in lock step behind a replica of the Granma on Monday, followed by a sea of banner- and flag-waving Cubans, many bussed in and organized through their workplaces and neighborhoods.\n\n\"This is an important message of unity and strength,\" said Rene Lazo, 66, who, like most, got up well before the crack of dawn to participate in the parade.\n\n\"This is going to be a difficult year but we will keep working hard to bring our people forwards\".\n\nCommunist-ruled Cuba fell into an economic recession in the second half of last year, its first since the collapse of the Soviet Union a quarter century ago, as its strategic ally Venezuela floundered.\n\nMeanwhile its historic detente with the United States came under threat with the election of Donald Trump as President. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said he would unravel attempts to normalize relations unless he gets a \"better deal\".\n\nAll this is taking place as Cuba is also coming to terms with the loss of its revolutionary leader, Fidel Castro. While \"El Comandante\" had handed the presidency over to his younger brother Raul in 2008, he remained a key figurehead.\n\nSome of those marching held up images of Castro or banners reading \"We are Fidel\". While the parade normally takes place every five years on Dec. 2, it was postponed a month due to his death in late November.\n\n\"He may not be present physically but he is in all our hearts,\" said Natalia Gonzales, who had painted \"I am Fidel\" on the foreheads of her three grandchildren.\n\nRaul Castro and his family watched and waved at those marching from the foot of the towering monument to independence hero Jose Marti in the center of the square.\n\nThe mood on Monday was of defiance although many Cubans said they hoped there would not be a return of Cold War-era politics.\n\n\"We are braced for conflict with the USA, we always have been,\" said 70-year-old Marcial Garcia. \"But I hope Trump will instead follow the path ... towards normalization.\"\n\nTrump's threat to gradual and still fragile detente could not come at a worse time for Cuba.\n\nA tourism boom in part sparked by looser travel restrictions on Americans failed last year to offset dwindling oil shipments from Venezuela and less cash for Cuban doctors and other professionals working overseas.\n\n\"Everything is just very uncertain at the moment, so there's more propaganda,\" said Antonio Sosa, 50, an engineer who chose not to attend the parade. \"You don't see news on the news broadcast anymore, just speeches Fidel gave 30 years ago.\"",

The alert was lifted around 11:15 a.m. when police notified administrators that Kessler was in custody.\n\nThe incident prompted a response from the U.S. Border Patrol, the North Dakota Highway Patrol, the Burke County Sheriff's Office, Bureau of Criminal Investigation, several deputies from the Williams County Sheriff's Office and members of the Minot SWAT team, who surrounded the home before Kessler came out.\n\nInvestigators from the Divide County Sheriff's Office and the Bureau of Criminal Investigation spent hours Tuesday afternoon combing through the small house and inspecting the surrounding property, including the exterior of other houses nearby.\n\nAgents removed a number of rifles from the residence, along with what appeared to be ammunition boxes.",

Richard Marcellais, D-Belcourt, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and one of the bill's sponsors, said he is disappointed with the vote.\n\n\"It's not going to improve the communications or relations between the state and tribes,\" he said.\n\nMarcellais sponsored similar legislation in 2009 that also failed in the Senate with a similar vote.",

    "text": "\"That's a good first step,\" Perkins said. \"That was good to get out with probably a little more intensity than I imagined. To feel like I could push it is exciting.\"\n\nSet to take Wednesday off from throwing before long-tossing again on Thursday, Perkins had some anxious moments over the weekend after canceling a planned bullpen session on Feb. 10. He used air quotes around the word \"setback,\" but it wasn't ideal when he felt soreness in his teres minor, one of the rotator cuff muscles involved in the external rotation of the shoulder joint.\n\n\"I think it had been bugging me longer than I thought,\" Perkins said. \"I just thought it was part of rehabbing and a little discomfort, but I think it had been lingering for a while, a month or so maybe. I forgot what it was like to feel good.\"\n\nHaving hit every marker on his rehab calendar since June 23 surgery to repair a torn labrum, Perkins figures it was inevitable he'd have to back off at some point. The good news is Tuesday's moderate-intensity throwing session presented no challenges, physical or otherwise.\n\n\"They say that when you have the front of your shoulder fixed, eventually you're going to develop some sort of soreness or something in the back,\" Perkins said. \"It was bound to happen. It's just how your arm works. It was a matter of time before something happened.\"\n\nPerkins, who threw as usual under the eye of rehab coordinator Lanning Tucker, noted he was able to get about 7 months into an eight-month rehab schedule before he had to scale back a bit.\n\n\"I was lucky with that,\" he said. \"The whole thing had been laid out, and so you try to get through it that way and it doesn't always work. I don't think anyone's ever done that. I had a little soreness, and it went away in a couple days.\"\n\nA three-time all-star set to turn 34 on March 2, Perkins is entering the last guaranteed year of a contract extension he signed in the spring of 2014. He anticipates throwing his next bullpen session on Friday or Saturday but will be careful not to look too far ahead.\n\n\"I'm taking it day by day. I'm not getting that far ahead,\" he said. \"I got too far ahead last week. I was thinking about that bullpen a week before I threw it. You've got to focus on something when you've gone that long. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to play catch on Thursday.\"\n\nThe Twins will be careful not to rush Perkins, who hasn't pitched since the opening week of the 2016 season. He figures to see his game action limited to back fields until the latter portion of spring training, and he said last month a season-opening stint on the disabled list is a possibility.\n\n\"I just want to continue to feel good,\" he said. \"That will be my goal every day for the season - to come in and feel good. That will be a success if that's the case.\"",

    "text": "The criminal case against the 29-year-old Crookston man officially was closed Tuesday after Judge Tamara Yon sentenced him in Polk County District Court for his actions during a confrontation with John Henry Torres, who died after hitting his head Dec. 25, 2015, outside Captain Crooks bar. Prosecutors failed to convince a jury that a shove from Strommen caused Torres' death.\n\nStrommen didn't deny pushing Torres, but he said he never saw Torres fall, suggesting the victim slipped on the ice.\n\nTorres died a week later at Altru Hospital in Grand Forks due to head injuries.\n\nLast month, jurors acquitted Strommen of the most serious charges: first-degree manslaughter, a felony; and fifth-degree assault, a misdemeanor. The jury did find Strommen guilty of misdemeanor disorderly conduct.\n\nYon sentenced Strommen to 90 days in jail, the maximum sentence for the charge under Minnesota law. But Strommen will get credit for time served, meaning he does not have to spend anymore time in jail. He was ordered to pay $1,085 in court fees and fines.\n\nTorres' fiancee, Rita Saenz, faced Strommen in court, telling him \"you destroyed my family.\" She insisted Strommen killed the man she loved, though she was not present during the altercation.\n\n\"He doesn't feel bad, I see nothing but evilness in his eyes,\" Saenz told Forum News Service. \"I wanted him to look at me, look at my kids so that he could see what I have to see with my kids every day.\"\n\nStrommen remained silent throughout Tuesday's hearing, only shaking his head when Yon asked if he had anything to say before his sentencing. Strommen did not look at Saenz during the hearing. He also declined to give comment to reporters from WDAZ.\n\nSaenz told WDAZ she felt the justice system failed her, adding her family will never see closure.\n\n\"I tried everything I could do,\" she said. \"I tried to do it, and I feel like I failed my husband because I was going to get justice, and I wasn't able to do that.\"\n\nWDAZ and the Grand Forks Herald are owned by the Forum Communications Co.",

A New Jersey mother says a police officer interrogated her 9-year-old son after he was suspected of a racial slur when he talked about brownies, the baked good.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission pondered whether a worker committed racial harassment by wearing a cap emblazoned with the Gadsden flag (depicting a coiled rattlesnake, with the words \"Don't Tread on Me\"). A University of Iowa professor complained that the Hawkeyes' mascot Herky, a fierce bird, is \"conveying an invitation to aggressivity and even violence\" that is discordant with the \"all accepting, nondiscriminatory messages we are trying to convey.\"\n\nAs President's Day approached, San Diego advised city workers to use \"bias-free language\" by avoiding the phrase \"Founding Fathers.\" A National Park Service employee giving guided tours to Independence Hall in Philadelphia told tourists that the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were produced by \"class elites who were just out to protect their privileged status.\" The employee praised herself for her \"bravery.\"\n\nThe NBA, which plays preseason games in China, home of forced abortions and organ harvests, moved its 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte because of North Carolina's law stipulating that transgender individuals should use bathrooms appropriate to their physiology.\n\nThe New York Times reported the downside of humanity's mastery of fire: \"Figuring out how to make fire was no doubt an evolutionary boon to our ancestors. But it may have led to our smoking habit.\" Facing a budget shortfall in 2010, New York's Legislature raised the cigarette tax $1.60 to $4.35 per pack, expecting, illogically, that it would discourage smoking and raise $290 million annually. By 2016, cigarette revenues had fallen 25 percent, and smuggled cigarettes held 58 percent of the New York market.\n\nBy 2016, six years after the president's wife agitated for federal guidelines limiting sodium, sugar, fats and calories in school lunches, 1.4 million students had exited the National School Lunch Program, and students had a robust black market in salt and sugar. A tweet with the hashtag #ThanksMichelleObama said, \"The first lady can have a personal chef, but I can't have two packets of ketchup?\"\n\nAfter Connecticut imposed its fifth tax increase since 2011, General Electric moved its headquarters from there to Boston. CKE Restaurants includes the Carl's Jr. chain, which was founded in California and ignited the fast-food industry. CKE announced that it was moving its headquarters from California (highest income tax rate: 13 percent) to Tennessee (highest income tax rate: zero).\n\nCongress considered bills to prevent the IRS from hiring or retaining people delinquent in their tax payments.

They said the rule technically became final when it was published in the Federal Register.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to have a judge declare that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acted unlawfully and to order the agency to rescind the rule delaying the bumble bee's listing.\n\n\"The science is clear-this species is headed toward extinction, and soon. There is no legitimate reason to delay federal protections,\" Natural Resources Defense Council senior attorney Rebecca Riley said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nBumble bees pollinate wildflowers and about a third of U.S. crops, from blueberries to tomatoes, according to the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation.\n\nThe bee's population and range have declined by more than 90 percent since the late 1990s due to disease, pesticides, climate change and habitat loss, according to wildlife officials.\n\nThe insect is one of 47 varieties of native bumble bees in the United States and Canada, more than a quarter of which face the risk of extinction, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.\n\nIn September, seven varieties of yellow-faced bees in Hawaii became the first such insects to be added to the U.S. list of endangered species because of losses due to habitat destruction, wildfires and the invasion of nonnative plants and insects.",

They didn't call 911.\n\nThis month, the Grand Forks Police Department put out a reminder that those using and possessing drugs who are present at the time of an overdose will not be prosecuted if they call and cooperate with first responders.\n\nIn North Dakota and Minnesota, Good Samaritan laws are on the books that give immunity to those who call in drug overdoses if the caller remains on scene until first responders arrive and cooperate with medical services and law enforcement. The person must be in need of emergency medical services. Up to three people can be granted immunity.\n\nThe law also applies to people overdosing from alcohol consumption.\n\n\"We want people to be focused on saving a life,\" said Lt.

    "text": "It described the Reina nightclub, where many foreigners as well as Turks were killed, as a gathering point for Christians celebrating their \"apostate holiday\". The attack, it said, was revenge for Turkish military involvement in Syria.\n\n\"The apostate Turkish government should know that the blood of Muslims shed with airplanes and artillery fire will, with God's permission, ignite a fire in their own land,\" the Islamic State declaration said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Turkish officials.\n\nThe jihadist group has been blamed for at least half a dozen attacks on civilian targets in Turkey over the past 18 months; but, other than assassinations, this is the first time it has directly claimed any of them. It made the statement on one of its Telegram channels, a method used after attacks elsewhere.\n\nNATO member Turkey is part of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State and launched an incursion into neighboring Syria in August to drive the radical Sunni militants from its borders, sending in tanks and special forces backed by fighter jets.\n\nNationals of Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Morocco, Libya, Israel, India, Canada, a Turkish-Belgian dual citizen and a Franco-Tunisian woman were among those killed at the nightclub on the shores of the Bosphorus waterway. Twenty-five of the dead were foreigners, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency.\n\nAll of those killed died from gunshot wounds, some of them shot at a very close distance or even point-blank range, according to a forensics report quoted by Milliyet newspaper.\n\nPolice distributed a hazy black-and-white photo of the alleged gunman taken from security footage. State broadcaster TRT Haber said eight people had been detained in Istanbul.\n\nThe authorities believe the attacker may be from a Central Asian nation and suspect he had links to Islamic State, the Hurriyet newspaper said. It said he may be from the same cell responsible for a gun-and-bomb attack on Istanbul's main airport in June, in which 45 people were killed and hundreds wounded.\n\nThe attack at Reina, popular with Turkish celebrities and wealthy visitors, shook Turkey as it tries to recover from a failed July coup and a series of deadly bombings, some blamed on Islamic State, others claimed by Kurdish militants.\n\nAround 600 people were thought to be inside when the gunman shot dead a policeman and civilian at the door, forcing his way in then opening fire with an automatic assault rifle. Witnesses said he shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is Greatest).\n\nSome at the exclusive club jumped into the Bosphorus after the attacker opened fire at random just over an hour into the new year. Witnesses described how he shot the wounded as they lay on the ground.\n\nThe attacker was believed to have taken a taxi from the southern Zeytinburnu district of Istanbul and, because of the busy traffic, got out and walked the last four minutes to the entrance of the nightclub, newspaper Haberturk said.\n\nHe pulled his Kalashnikov rifle from a suitcase at the side of the road, opened fire on those at the door, then threw two hand grenades after entering, Haberturk said, without citing its sources. It said six empty magazines were found at the scene and that he was estimated to have fired at least 180 bullets.\n\nSecurity services had been on alert across Europe for new year celebrations following an attack on a Christmas market in Berlin that killed 12 people. Only days ago, an online message from a pro-Islamic State group called for attacks by \"lone wolves\" on \"celebrations, gatherings and clubs\".\n\nIn a statement hours after the shooting, President Tayyip Erdogan said such attacks aimed to create chaos and destabilize the country.\n\nFour months into its operation in Syria, the Turkish army and the rebels it backs are besieging the Islamic State-held town of al-Bab. Erdogan has said he wants them to continue to Raqqa, the jihadists' Syrian stronghold.\n\nTurkey has also been cracking down on Islamic State networks at home. In counter-terrorism operations between Dec 26-Jan 2, Turkish police detained 147 people over links to the group and formally arrested 25 of them, the interior ministry said.\n\nThe New Year's Day attack came five months after a failed military coup, in which more than 240 people were killed, many of them in Istanbul, as rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and fighter jets in a bid to seize power.\n\nMore than 100,000 people, including soldiers and police officers, have been sacked or suspended in a subsequent crackdown ordered by Erdogan, raising concern both about civic rights and the effectiveness of Turkey's security apparatus.",

That's when we're at our best, in a fast-paced game.''\n\nPolynice had 10 of his game-high 22 points in the run, in which the Riders poured in the 21 points in a 4:35 span to build a 53-31 advantage.\n\nPierson Painter had a 3-point basket in the big spurt; otherwise, it was Red River scoring by attacking the basket.

In this area, let us adhere, clearly and faithfully, to 'zero tolerance',\" he said.\n\nThe comments, included in a letter about the plight of vulnerable children in general, were some of his most comprehensive on abuse.\n\nAnne Barrett-Doyle, founder of the U.S.-based research and monitoring group BishopAccountablity.org, said in an email that the pope's words were little more than rhetoric.\n\n\"This pope keeps proclaiming zero tolerance but doesn't enact it. He knows full well that Church law contains no zero tolerance provision. Zero tolerance is mere rhetoric. The sad fact is that the Church still has not changed its system to make zero tolerance a binding reality,\" she said.\n\nShe said that while it existed in the United States, it is \"still optional in the global Catholic Church\".\n\nFrancis, who has met victims of sexual abuse several times, both in the Vatican and on some of his foreign trips, said: \"We join in the pain of the victims and weep for this sin - the sin of what happened, the sin of failing to help, the sin of covering up and denial, the sin of the abuse of power.\"\n\nIn 2015, Francis ordered the trial and defrocking of a Polish archbishop accused of paying for sex with minors in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe year before, he set up a Vatican commission, including some victims, to advise local Churches on how to prevent abuse. But some members have complained about the slow pace of change in the Vatican.\n\nFrancis also approved the establishment of a Vatican tribunal to judge bishops accused of covering up sexual abuse or failing to prevent it, but the proposal has so far stalled.\n\nChurch sexual abuse broke into the open in 2002, when it was discovered that U.S. bishops moved abusers from parish to parish instead of defrocking them. Similar scandals were later discovered around the world and tens of millions of dollars have been paid in compensation.",

    "title": "Mathison: Setting a big goal? You might want to keep your lips zipped",
    "text": "Common sense suggests that when you've got a big goal, like committing to a new workout routine, eating better, losing weight, or perhaps writing a book or starting a business, you should tell as many people as possible.\n\nAfter all, if lots of friends know about your goal, you'll be motivated to work harder because you don't want to disappoint yourself or your community.\n\nPlus, your friends will check in with you, and push you, and hold you accountable so that you don't quit on yourself. Right?\n\nIn his 3-minute TED Talk, Derek Sivers shares a surprising idea: Telling people about your goal makes it less likely to happen.\n\nAs Derek explains, some researchers think it has something to do with the power of \"social acknowledgment.\"\n\nFor example, let's say you announce to your best friend: \"I'm going to train for 5K race! This year, I'm really doing it!\"\n\nYour friend responds by saying: \"Congratulations! What a great goal. You can do it. I'm so proud of you.\"\n\nAs you listen to your friend's encouragement, praise and acknowledgment, you feel really great! You feel accepted, appreciated and full of warm, fuzzy feelings.\n\nBut there's a catch: once your body is flooded with those types of warm feelings, you're actually less motivated to \"do the hard work\" that's necessary to reach your goal.\n\nIn a sense, your brain has been \"tricked\" into thinking you're already \"done.\" That's why telling people about your goals can be counter-productive. It gives you a \"premature sense of completeness.\" Or so the theory goes.\n\nMy personal opinion: It really depends on your personality and on the type of goal you're trying to achieve.\n\nIf your goal is to get a new job, for example, then it's important to tell lots of people, because the people in your professional network can point you towards possible job opportunities, write letters of recommendation and open all kinds of doors for you. You'll get farther and faster if you involve your community.\n\nBut in other instances, zipping your lips might be a good idea.\n\nIf you've been telling your friends, \"I'm going to write a book!\" for 10 years in a row, but you're making zero progress, then maybe you could try changing your approach. Zip your lips and start writing in secret. Maybe you'll find more success if you take the no-talking, action-only approach.\n\nMy personal goal was to crank out several more articles and get them polished and queued up for publication so that I don't have to worry about writing over the winter holiday break.\n\nBut instead, I got sidelined by a winter virus.",

    "title": "UPDATE: Former Twins manager Gardenhire battling prostate cancer",
    "text": "Gardenhire, 59, will travel back to Minnesota shortly before mid-April surgery, but the cancer was caught early and the prognosis is good for a full recovery.\n\nGardenhire told the Arizona Republic that he expects to return roughly six weeks after surgery but added on a conference call with reporters that he still must undergo additional tests to make sure the cancer hasn't spread.\n\n\"I don't think anybody can say 100 percent of anything when you're dealing with cancer,\" Gardenhire said. \"In talking with the doctors, they're been pretty optimistic. I feel pretty confident, and they do too, that we're going to go in there and take this thing out.\"\n\nThe second-winningest manager in Twins history, Gardenhire spent last season as a special assistant under former Twins general manager Terry Ryan, himself treated for cancer in 2014. Gardenhire managed the Twins to six division titles in his 13-year run from 2002-14.\n\nEven after getting fired after the 2014 season, Gardenhire continued to undergo annual physicals with Twins internist Dr. Vijay Eyunni. It was during a recent exam that Eyunni noticed Gardenhire's elevated PSA levels and ordered more tests, which came back positive for prostate cancer.\n\n\"Not only is Dr. Vijay my doctor, he's a very good friend,\" Gardenhire said. \"He wouldn't let me go without getting a physical. If I didn't show up when the rest of the guys do in January every year, he calls us and says, 'Get in here.' I tip my hat to him because he's done that for a lot of people, not just me.\"\n\nToby Gardenhire, the manager's son, was recently hired to a full-time coaching role with the Gulf Coast League Twins after serving in a part-time capacity last season. The younger Gardenhire spent the past five seasons as head baseball coach at Wisconsin-Stout.\n\n\"That's bad news,\" Twins closer Glen Perkins said of Ron Gardenhire's cancer diagnosis. \"I've known him for a long time. I guess you just pray for him and hope that they catch it early and they'll be able to get him fixed up. He's got a good sense of humor. He's got a great attitude about everything. Hopefully, he'll continue that.\"\n\nPerkins lost a grandfather to bone cancer that started out as prostate cancer. He was close with former Gophers pitching coach Todd Oakes, who died last spring after a long battle with leukemia, and was part of a contingent of Twins employees that recently visited former Twins bullpen coach Rick Stelmaszek, who is 68 and battling pancreatitis.\n\n\"It's not fun watching people go through cancer,\" Perkins said. \"I've had too much experience with that lately. Cancer sucks.\"\n\nGardenhire said many friends have reached out to him since his diagnosis was revealed, including Diamondbacks team owner Ken Kendrick and team president Derrick Hall, both of whom overcame prostate cancer.\n\n\"There's a lot of people reaching out to me that have been through it, including some good close friends of mine there in the Twin Cities,\" Gardenhire said. \"Like a lot of people in this country and all over, I'm joining a fight personally against this thing - cancer. We're going to attack it. (Wife) Carol and I and my kids, we understand it and we're going to go through it and we're going to keep our heads high and push on.\"\n\nThe St. Paul Pioneer Press is a media partner with Forum News Service",

    "title": "Editorial: Kennedy should learn from reaction to proposed hire",
    "text": "A key bottom line: The position is important, even vital. Why is Kennedy himself among North Dakota's highest paid public servants? Simple: Because Kennedy's salary is leverage. It's an investment by North Dakota in Kennedy's talent and connections, traits that Kennedy is expected to use to raise tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars for the university.\n\nFundraising is a huge part of a modern university president's job. So is running the complicated institution in a way that grows its reputation and strength.\n\nIf Kennedy succeeds at those goals, then North Dakota's investment will have more than paid off. And if the event coordinator helps Kennedy succeed, then the state will have spent its money wisely there, too.\n\nFurthermore, critics hurt their case when they dismiss the coordinator as a \"bartender.\" A glance at the job description sets the record straight. The description lists more than 50 duties, of which \"serve as bartender during events\" is only one.\n\nOther duties include \"initiate, plan and coordinate all official entertaining events hosted by the president and first lady,\" \"coordinate all catering arrangements,\" \"extend invitations and coordinate RSVP follow-up,\" \"on-site management of the event,\" \"track expenses,\" \"oversee payment\" and dozens of others.\n\nAs a thoughtful letter in Monday's Herald concluded, \"to reduce the impressive multi-tasking that the event coordinator must do to just one of the more trivial duties in the job description is a disservice to her (the retiring incumbent's) valuable work and presence at UND.\"\n\nThat said, Kennedy must realize that with every UND staffer and student anxious about where the ax will fall, his own hiring decisions will be second guessed. People are watching, and a key to getting \"buy in\" from them will be showing that the administration is sharing-not just feeling-their pain.\n\nThat's where Kennedy should direct his attention, because that's why this hire touched a nerve.\n\nIt's the timing-meaning the timing of this particular hire, and what it seems to be saying about Kennedy's approach to UND's fiscal squeeze.\n\nUND philosophy professor Jack Russell Weinstein was blunt about that perception. \"They're cutting the law school, they're cutting the radio station and they're cutting courses, and the president is hiring a party planner,\" Weinstein told Herald Staff Writer Andrew Hazzard.\n\nA few years ago, Altru Health System faced its own cutbacks. Here's how the headline in the next day's Herald read: \"Altru tightens its belt; senior leadership taking pay cut until end of 2013.\"\n\nAltru's approach generated comments, too; but those comments were a lot more forgiving of Altru's leaders. That's because the stakeholders knew the leaders were sharing in the sacrifice, not just doing it out. There's a lesson in that perception for Kennedy at UND.",

Gajeski had placed conversation prompts on each table in case any of the pairs needed help breaking the ice, but the cards seemed to go untouched as everyone chatted easily up until the time came to switch pairs.\n\nJim Laturnus said he found he had a lot in common with all of the women he visited.\n\n\"I had nothing to lose, really,\" he said of his choice to come to the event. \"I was just looking for companionship. I do know some of these other people here before. They're all fun. Every single one of them had something in common.\"\n\n\"We really had a good time, learned a little bit about each other,\" Roxie Lord said. \"I'm really glad I came.\" She added she approaches everything with the same positive attitude. \"A sense of humor is the best thing to have to keep going through life,\" she said.\n\nGajeski said in the future, the Senior Center may organize a similar event for women only so they can meet new friends. \"There's a lot of people that just moved here.

Gorgui Dieng added 12 points, but no other Timberwolves player reached double figures in scoring.\n\nA step-back 3-pointer by James and a fast break layup by former Timberwolves player Derrick Williams pushed Cleveland's lead to 114-106 with 1:39 to play.

Wiggins had 37 points through three quarters on 14-of-22 shooting but cooled off in the final quarter.\n\nCleveland's offense had to make up for the loss of forward Kevin Love, who earlier Tuesday had surgery on his left knee that will sideline him for six weeks. Love was averaging 20.0 points and 11.1 rebounds per game.\n\nIn Love's absence, three Cleveland starters topped the 20-point mark.

    "text": "After a brief cold snap moved into the region last week, temperatures have been about 20 degrees above normal, according to the National Weather Service. Highs statewide have lingered in the high 30s this week and are expected to climb into the low and mid-40s by the weekend, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n\"We have gotten into the 44 to 51 range for this week of February,\" NWS meteorologist Peter Speicher said of past weather readings. \"We've been as warm as 51 back in 2000. It's not totally uncommon, but it's still well above seasonal norms.\"\n\nAn extended outlook from NWS favors above-normal temperatures next week for most of the country except for the West Coast and Alaska.\n\nSome cities have a shot of setting record highs next week, and for Grand Forks, Sunday's record high could be the easiest to break. The city's high temperature record for Feb. 19, set last year, was 44 at the Grand Forks International Airport, and Speicher said Sunday's forecast calls for a high of 45 degrees.\n\n\"That would be the easiest to break,\" Speicher said.\n\nNo high records have been set in February so far this year.\n\nAbove-freezing temperatures could be good news for southern and western parts of North Dakota. The warm weather should speed up snowmelt, helping to remove excess moisture from river basins along watersheds.\n\nFields in the southern part of the Red River Valley have little snow compared with the Red River of the North starting near Hillsboro.\n\nPaths could open up as the snow melts, taking the excess water to rivers, streams and lakes. Areas should be on the lookout for rising water levels, but the melt taking off that excess water from snowpack slowly could help alleviate flooding in the spring, according to the NWS. Less snow could mean less moisture that could flow over the plains.\n\n\"Anything helps,\" Speicher said. \"It definitely helps that we are going back below freezing at night because that slows the flow rate down.\"\n\nIn the Devils Lake Basin, they could see above-freezing temperatures Wednesday and into the weekend, with some days going above 40 degrees.\n\nA slow melt can't hurt the Devils Lake Basin, said Jeff Frith, manager of the Devils lake Basin Joint Water Resource Board. The region surrounding the 150,000-acre lake likely will see major flooding due to heavy snow and saturated soil from a wet summer and fall. NWS meteorologists predict a 2-foot to 4-foot rise with record runoff and possibly elevations.\n\nThere still is a lot of winter left and potential for more snow, though Devils Lake has been lucky since snowfall has been relatively low for moisture accumulation in January and into mid-February, he said.\n\n\"A long, slow melt would be just what the doctor ordered, but I think we have way too much winter left to start getting really excited about spring,\" Frith said.\n\nNWS meteorologists were assessing snowpack and other factors that will play a role in predicting flood outlooks. The agency's second spring flood outlook is due Thursday, though Frith doesn't expect much to change since the last one was released almost three weeks ago.\n\nThe Midwest likely will see more precipitation than normal in February, and that trend should continue into April, according to NWS. There is no precipitation forecast for this week, though there is a 50 percent chance of next week being wetter than normal.\n\nOverall, February for almost all of the U.S. should be warmer than normal. Colder-than-normal temperatures could return by the end of February and into early March, NWS meteorologists predict.",

Gergel also banned relatives of the victims from attending.\n\nThe judge previously found Roof competent to stand trial after a hearing held in November ahead of the guilt phase but on Monday was due to hear new testimony from forensic psychiatrist James Ballenger, who examined Roof for five hours over the weekend, Gergel said.\n\nRoof's standby lawyers filed a motion arguing that Roof was not competent to stand trial or represent himself after he revealed at a hearing last week that he would present no evidence or witnesses during the sentencing phase.\n\nHis announcement raised \"in especially stark fashion the question of whether the defendant is actually unable to defend himself,\" the lawyers said in a court filing.\n\nA team led by prominent capital defense lawyer David Bruck represented Roof during the guilt phase of the trial.\n\nRoof has opted to represent himself for the sentencing phase, due to begin on Tuesday, and has sought to keep jurors from hearing evidence about his competency and mental health.",

But they opened the second half with a stretch in which, on their first 13 possessions, they scored on 11 of them while turning the ball over twice.\n\n\"I don't know if a stretch like that happens very often for anybody,'' Red River coach Kent Ripplinger said. \"Sometimes we rush things and don't take care of the ball. We took care of the ball and found open players in that run.''\n\nLexi Robson and Kendra Bohm each had six points to set the pace as the 16-3 Riders stretched their three-point halftime lead to 45-27 with 10:52 remaining. Central was behind by double figures for most of the remainder of the game until putting together a 7-0 run to pull within 64-56 with 46 seconds left.\n\nRobson had 38 points when Red River beat Central 71-59 in the teams' first game. She had a game-high 18 points this time, but Red River had more balance. Bohm added 12 points and Danica Kemnitz and reserve Maggie Steffen each added 10.\n\n\"That (balance) is something we wanted to get done,'' Ripplinger said. \"We needed more offense from our post players and Kendra and Danica came through. We got four players in double figures. Typically, it's more like two or three.''\n\nRed River had a 13-0 run in the first half, but Central still was within three points at intermission.\n\n\"If you don't give up runs like that, you don't get yourself in trouble,'' Central coach D.J. Burris said. \"And (allowing big runs) has been a bit of a problem for us.''\n\nLauren Dub's 16 points led the 9-10 Knights. Amber Anderson added a season-high 11 points to go with eight rebounds.",

Gary Sukut, R-Williston, the primary sponsor of the bill, said communities in the Bakken rely on oil tax revenue to pay for expanded law enforcement facilities, new water plants and other infrastructure they added to meet unprecedented growth spurred by oil development.\n\nOfficials from so-called Bakken hub cities of Dickinson, Williston and Minot, as well as smaller communities in the Oil Patch, testified during a hearing on the bill that the funding is essential so they can continue making debt payments.\n\nInitially the bill had a $33.5 million fiscal impact to keep the communities receiving the same amount of funding they received last biennium. The bill was amended to have a $7.65 million fiscal impact.\n\nIn addition, the bill includes funding for airports in Williston and Dickinson and other oil impact grant funding that was approved during the last session but has not yet been delivered due to budget shortfalls.\n\nSeveral legislators from western North Dakota spoke in favor of the bill.\n\n\"Many people feel that things are dead or dying in western North Dakota, but it couldn't be further from the truth,\" said Rep. Denton Zubke, R-Watford City.\n\nCarlson and other legislators said they'll discuss funding for western North Dakota again in a different budget after they have an updated picture of the revenue forecast.\n\n\"It does not need to be decided today.

    "text": "Whether it's the infamous \"Veterans For Standing Rock\" with their missing $1.1 million, or another organization in the litany of Standing Rock-based pages on the website, rough estimates for the amount raised on these pages have been reported to be around $11 million. Just as a point of reference, the state of North Dakota already has spent more than $30 million managing the crisis these donations were meant to fund.\n\nAll of this begs the question of whether GoFundMe shoulders any of the blame for providing a platform to fundraise for illegal protest activities-activities that include repeated violent attacks against our North Dakota law enforcement officers, using everything from Molotov cocktails and other improvised explosive devices to actual guns.\n\nDo the site's owners care that they are actively enabling professional protesters to come into our community and disrupt the lives and livelihoods of both the residents of Morton County and members of the Standing Rock tribe alike?\n\nWhen you take a deeper look at GoFundMe, it becomes clear that the answer is no.\n\nGoFundMe is a business. And their business is fundraising for \"causes\" like these protesters. In 2015, Forbes magazine published an article outlining how GoFundMe earns \"profits off of controversy.\" As the company outlines in its \"Common Questions\" page, GoFundMe takes a 5 percent fee from every contribution made over the site, along with an additional 3 percent processing fee.\n\nMeaning the company has made roughly $880,000 off of these DAPL protests without having to do a thing beyond maintaining the website.\n\nPretty good haul for just shy of six months.\n\nWhile the website has no official ideological loyalty, all you have to do is look at members of the company's senior leadership to get an idea of where they fall on the political spectrum.\n\nThe company's chairman and CEO, Rob Solomon, gave the maximum amount in contributions allowed by law to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. President and Chief Product Officer David Hahn is a former staffer for ultra-liberal California Senator Diane Feinstein.\n\nAnd GoFundMe's vice president for communications and policy is none other than Dan Pfeiffer, former senior advisor, White House communications director and long-time confidant of President Obama.\n\nShockingly, there are no former Republican political staff members serving as executives for GoFundMe.\n\nSo the truth is, despite the violent and illegal behavior these GoFundMe pages are supporting, the company probably doesn't care. They are probably indifferent to the close to 600 people who have been arrested during these protests, or the public posting of threats against police officers, community leaders and their families.\n\nThey're making a hefty profit while supporting the liberal causes they personally believe in, while never having to leave sunny California.\n\nIt's all win-win for them, even if it's all lose-lose for North Dakota and its residents.\n\nHennen is the host of What's On Your Mind radio show, heard throughout North Dakota on AM 1100 TheFlag and AM 550 KFYR.",

    "text": "Sen. Terry Wanzek, R-Jamestown, tried to attach an amendment to the North Dakota Department of Transportation budget bill requiring the agency to keep all of the state's shops in operation through mid-2019. The amendment would also provide for a legislative study of the shops' proposed closure \"and the impact of services in the areas affected,\" as well as the possibility of cooperating with local political subdivisions.\n\nThe amendment ultimately failed and the budget passed the Senate Appropriations Committee Tuesday morning. Wanzek said he intends to try to amend the bill on the Senate floor.\n\nWanzek said he wasn't enthusiastic about micromanaging the DOT, but \"the outcry that I've heard from members in my district that have these shops in their area, it is overwhelming.\"\n\n\"I just feel that this is something, that in representing the people of my district, that I have to bring forward,\" he added.\n\nThe amended DOT budget includes a $66.4 million reduction in operating expenses from the $295.8 million included in the base budget, a 22 percent decrease. It also decreases the full-time equivalent positions in the department by 31.5, from 1,080.5 to 1,049.\n\nJamie Olson, a DOT spokeswoman, said the proposed consolidation of eight maintenance \"sections\" into neighboring facilities would save about $2.1 million in the coming two-year budget cycle. She said the buildings are aging and today's snowplows can cover more miles.\n\n\"They're able to do more than they were before,\" Olson said. \"Those rural roads that some of these sections lie on, there's still going to be service. They're just going to be serviced out of the next shop over.\"\n\nThe shops slated for closure are in Starkweather, Finley, Fessenden, Gackle, Litchville, New England, Courtenay and Mayville, Olson said. There are 67 section shops across the state, Olson said, along with with additional shops at the eight main district locations.\n\nSen. Gary Lee, R-Casselton, said the DOT was asked to \"look at their budgets critically just like everyone else was.\" Olson said the department saw a 13 percent decline in 2015 in highway tax distribution revenues, a main source of funding for operations, because of a slower economy and lower fuel tax collections.\n\n\"We ask them to seek out efficiencies, and then we tell them we don't want them,\" Lee said in arguing against Wanzek's amendment.\n\nBut Sen. John Grabinger, D-Jamestown, there has been a \"grassroots effort\" with petitions attempting to persuade lawmakers and department officials.\n\n\"They're going out to every farm and everything, getting these signatures,\" he said. \"It is important to these people.\"",

    "text": "After a brief cold snap moved into the region last week, temperatures have been about 20 degrees above normal, according to the National Weather Service. Grand Forks' high went from 2 degrees last Wednesday to 22 on Thursday and 38 on Friday, a 36-degree jump in two days. Highs have lingered in the high 30s this week and are expected to climb into the low and mid-40s by the weekend, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n\"We have gotten into the 44 to 51 range for this week of February,\" NWS meteorologist Pete Speicher said of past weather readings. \"We've been as warm as 51 back in 2000. It's not totally uncommon, but it's still well above seasonal norms.\"\n\nAn extended outlook from NWS favors above-normal temperatures next week for most of the country except for the West Coast and Alaska. Northwest Minnesota and northeast North Dakota have a 70 to 90 percent chance of seeing unseasonably warm weather.\n\nSome cities have a shot of setting record highs. The lowest record high for next week was set Feb. 19, 2016, at the Grand Forks International Airport with 44 degrees.\n\n\"That would be the easiest to break,\" Speicher said, adding the forecast for Sunday is 45 degrees.\n\nNo high records have been set in February so far this year.\n\nAbove-freezing temperatures could be good news for southern and western parts of North Dakota. The warm weather should speed up snowmelt, helping to remove excess moisture from river basins along watersheds.\n\nFields in the southern part of the Red River Valley have little snow compared with the Red River of the North starting near Hillsboro.\n\nPaths could open up as the snow melts, taking the excess water to rivers, streams and lakes. Areas should be on the lookout for rising water levels, but but the melt taking off that excess water from snowpack slowly could help alleviate flooding in the spring, according to the NWS. Less snow could mean less moisture that could flow over the plains.\n\n\"Anything helps,\" Speicher said. \"It definitely helps that we are going back below freezing at night because that slows the flow rate down.\"\n\nTo the west, Devils Lake could see above-freezing temperatures today and into the weekend, with some days going above 40 degrees.\n\nA slow melt can't hurt the Devils Lake Basin, said Jeff Frith, manager of the Devils lake Basin Joint Water Resource Board. The region surrounding the 150,000-acre lake likely will see major flooding due to heavy snow and saturated soil from a wet summer and fall. NWS meteorologists predict a 2- to 4-foot rise with record runoff and possibly elevations.\n\nThere still is a lot of winter left and potential for more snow, though Devils Lake has been lucky since snowfall has been relatively low for moisture accumulation in January and into mid-February, he said.\n\n\"A long, slow melt would be just what the doctor ordered, but I think we have way too much winter left to start getting really excited about spring,\" Frith said.\n\nNWS meteorologists were assessing snowpack and other factors that will play a role in predicting flood outlooks. The agency's second spring flood outlook is due Thursday, though Frith doesn't expect much to change since the last one was released almost three weeks ago.\n\nThe Midwest likely will see more precipitation than normal in February, and that trend should continue into April, according to NWS. There is no precipitation forecast for this week, though there is a 50 percent chance of next week being wetter than normal.\n\nOverall, February for almost all of the U.S. should be warmer than normal. Colder-than-normal temperatures could return by the end of February and into early March, NWS meteorologists predict.",

    "text": "North Dakotans don't take to reorganization.\n\nRather than going all the way back to statehood, let's just start with 1942, when the Public Administration Service of Chicago did a comprehensive analysis and reorganization plan for North Dakota state government. Some of the recommendations still are gathering dust today, indicating the low priority we place on reorganization.\n\nRather than implementing the report, state officials of the day thought it would be best to wait until after World War II was over. The connection between reorganization and the war was never explained, but by the time the War was over, dust had buried the recommendations.\n\nIn 1966, voters rejected proposals to revamp the judicial, executive and legislative branches of government. So the reinventors thought of a different route-a constitutional convention to dramatize the need for reform.\n\nThe convention met. The proposed constitution would have made possible reducing the number of elected state officials down to the nationwide average of six per state. Opposed by every state official and others, the document went down to defeat,\n\nIn 1984 and 2000, the voters refused to abolish the office of state treasurer, made obsolete in 1919 with the creation of the Bank of North Dakota.\n\nIn November 1980, the voters defeated another general proposal to revise the legislative and executive branches of government. In 1989, a similar measure was swamped at the polls.\n\nMeanwhile, disorganization was spreading in the underbrush. In 2009, Legislative Librarian Marilyn Johnson counted 142 boards, councils and commissions. (If your interest group doesn't have a board, council and/or commission, you simply haven't asked for one.)\n\nWe have more local governments per capita, the largest Legislature per capita outside of New Hampshire and the most elected state officials outside of South Carolina. So there is room for a lot of reinventing, but the governor should be forewarned that the holder of every public office will fight him to the death.\n\nThat's one reason we pretty much have the same government we started with in 1889.\n\nWhat this tells us is that North Dakotans like access, even when it means throwing efficiency under the bus.\n\nPeople want a role-a big role-in government. Having many points at which citizens can be a part of government implements the cultural idea that everybody is important and should \"have a say.\"\n\nIf we haven't dissuaded the governor from reinventing, he would be well advised to choose only those entities that have no constituencies, because constituencies rise up with a wrath when abolition or consolidation of their entity is proposed. For example, if he told the barbers he was going to mess with their licensing board, he would have to go out-of-state for a haircut.\n\nWhile the office holders, agencies and their constituencies will be arrayed against him, the governor will be spending lot of political capital on something about which the citizenry does not care a hoot, meaning that the governor will have no citizen uprising on behalf of reinventing. He'll be out there alone.\n\nReinventing North Dakota state and local governments would require the effort of a mountain to produce a molehill. As a recovering government reinventor, I wish the governor well but will just sit this one out.\n\nOn the other hand, it has been said that those who say it can't be done are sometimes interrupted by somebody doing it.\n\nOmdahl is a retired professor of political science at UND and a former lieutenant governor of North Dakota.",

He did not provide further details.\n\nSouth Korea's foreign ministry said it could not confirm the reports, and the country's intelligence agency could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nIn Washington, there was no immediate response to a request for comment from the Trump administration, which faces a stiff challenge from a defiant North Korea over its nuclear arms program and the test of a ballistic missile last weekend.\n\nKim Jong Nam was known to spend a significant amount of his time outside North Korea and had spoken out publicly against his family's dynastic control of the isolated state.\n\nIf confirmed as an assassination, it would the latest in a string of killings over the decades at home and abroad meant to silence those perceived by North Korea's leaders as threats to their authority, one of the U.S. sources said on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn a statement, Malaysian police said the dead man, 46, held a passport under the name Kim Chol.\n\nKim Jong Nam has been caught in the past using forged travel documents.\n\nMalaysian police official Fadzil Ahmat said the cause of Kim's death was not yet known, and that a post mortem would be carried out.\n\n\"So far there are no suspects, but we have started investigations and are looking at a few possibilities to get leads,\" Fadzil told Reuters.\n\nAccording to Fadzil, Kim had been planning to travel to Macau on Monday when he fell ill at the low-cost terminal of Kuala Lumpur International Airport.\n\n\"The deceased ... felt like someone grabbed or held his face from behind,\" Fadzil said. \"He felt dizzy, so he asked for help at the ... counter of KLIA.\"\n\nKim was taken to an airport clinic where he still felt unwell, and it was decided to take him to hospital. He died in the ambulance on the way to Putrajaya Hospital, Fadzil added.\n\nThe U.S. government sources said it was possible that Kim Jong Nam had been poisoned. They said it could not be ruled out that assassins used some kind of \"poison pen\" device.\n\nSouth Korea's TV Chosun, a cable-TV network, reported that Kim had been poisoned with a needle by two women believed to be North Korean operatives who fled in a taxi and were at large, citing multiple South Korean government sources.\n\nReuters could not independently confirm those details.\n\nMalaysia is one of a dwindling number of countries that has close relations with North Korea, which is under tightening global sanctions over its nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches, the latest of which took place on Sunday.\n\nMalaysians and North Koreans can visit each other's country without visas.\n\nA phone call to the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur late on Tuesday went straight to an answering machine.\n\nKim Jong Nam and Kim Jong Un are both sons of former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, who died in late 2011, but they had different mothers.\n\nKim Jong Nam, the elder of the two, did not attend his father's funeral. His mother was an actress named Song Hye Rim, and Kim Jong Nam said his father kept his parents' relationship secret.\n\nThe portly and easygoing Kim Jong Nam was believed to be close to his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who was North Korea's second most powerful man before being executed on Kim Jong Un's orders in 2013.\n\nIn an embarrassing 2001 incident, Kim Jong Nam was caught at an airport in Japan traveling on a forged Dominican Republic passport, saying he had wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. He was known to travel to Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China.\n\nKoh Yu-hwan, a professor at Dongguk University in Seoul, said Kim Jong Nam had occasionally been the subject of speculation that he could replace his younger half-brother, the country's third-generation leader.\n\n\"Loyalists may have wanted to get rid of him,\" he said.",

    "text": "She had overdosed. Someone had brought her to the clinic in the middle of the night, authorities said, but when the clinic was closed, whoever brought her abandoned the car and left. They didn't call 911.\n\nThis month, the Grand Forks Police Department put out a reminder that those using and possessing drugs who are present at the time of an overdose will not be prosecuted if they call and cooperate with first responders.\n\nIn North Dakota and Minnesota, Good Samaritan laws are on the books that give immunity to those who call in drug overdoses if the caller remains on scene until first responders arrive and cooperate with medical services and law enforcement. The person must be in need of emergency medical services. Up to three people can be granted immunity.\n\nThe law also applies to people overdosing from alcohol consumption.\n\n\"We want people to be focused on saving a life,\" said Lt. Jeremy Moe with the special resource bureau.\n\nIn 2016, Grand Forks Police responded to 28 calls for overdoses. Three of them were fatal.\n\nState Sen. Howard Anderson Jr., R-Turtle Lake, was a sponsor of the Good Samaritan laws that passed in North Dakota in 2015. The former director of the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy, Anderson said he wanted to sponsor the law to give people a better chance to survive. Information provided by companions can be key to successful care.\n\n\"It's hard to find out what they took or what the situation is, so by the time doctors get a chance to figure out what it is, it's too late,\" Anderson said.\n\nIn the process of passing the law, legislators heard testimony from a man whose companions had abandoned him in a dumpster, thinking he'd overdosed, Anderson said.\n\nBut too few people know about the law, Anderson said. He also believes law enforcement have been overzealous in pressing charges against people, despite the law.\n\n\"They're using the Good Samaritan laws as an excuse to charge people because, obviously, if I gave you drugs, then I'm guilty of providing them for you. It's like a sale even if I gave it to you free,\" he said. \"So we need a little better education with police. If you're trying to save somebody's life for crying out loud, back off a little bit. Catch the crook the next time.\"\n\nAnderson said users speak to one another, and if law enforcement is too aggressive, it might deter people from calling for help.\n\nGrand Forks Police said they were not aware of any specific incidents in town where immunity had been granted based on the Good Samaritan laws.\n\nForum News Service contributed to this article.",

    "text": "The letter, dated Monday and addressed to a White House ethics official, asked President Donald Trump's administration to investigate the incident and gave it two weeks to provide its findings and detail any disciplinary steps taken.\n\nConway, Trump's presidential campaign manager and now a senior counselor, said on Fox News last week that Americans should \"go buy Ivanka's stuff.\" She spoke after retailer Nordstrom announced it was dropping the branded line of Ivanka Trump, the president's older daughter.\n\nFederal ethics rules prohibit executive branch employees from using their positions to endorse products.\n\n\"There is strong reason to believe that Ms. Conway has violated the Standards of Conduct and that disciplinary action is warranted,\" Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub wrote in the letter.\n\nStefan Passantino, the White House ethics official named in the letter, declined to comment. A White House spokesman did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe ethics office has little enforcement power. It can formally recommend disciplinary action if the White House does not act, Shaub said in a separate letter to two U.S. lawmakers who sought a review of Conway's remarks.\n\nThat recommendation would not be binding, and the process would take until late April or early May, Shaub said. If the ethics office does formally recommend discipline, it would be up to the White House to decide any steps against Conway.\n\nNorman Eisen, who was ethics chief under President Barack Obama, said Congress also could call hearings or subpoena documents if the White House did not act.\n\nTrump himself earlier attacked Nordstrom for dropping his daughter's brand. The ethics rules that bar endorsements do not apply to the president, though critics said his comments were inappropriate.\n\nNordstrom said it made the decision because sales had steadily declined, especially in the last half of 2016, to where carrying the line \"didn't make good business sense.\"\n\nIn his letter to the White House, Shaub wrote that his office's regulatory guidelines include an example violation in which a hypothetical presidential appointee promotes a product in a television commercial. He said Conway's remarks closely mirrored that example of what not to do.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Thursday that Conway had been \"counseled,\" but Shaub wrote that the Office of Government Ethics had not been informed of any corrective steps.",

    "title": "CDC considers lowering threshold level for lead exposure",
    "text": "Since 2012, the CDC, which sets public health standards for exposure to lead, has used a blood lead threshold of 5 micrograms per deciliter for children under age 6. While no level of lead exposure is safe for children, those who test at or above that level warrant a public health response, the agency says.\n\nBased on new data from a national health survey, the CDC may lower its reference level to 3.5 micrograms per deciliter in the coming months, according to six people briefed by the agency. The measure will come up for discussion at a CDC meeting January 17 in Atlanta.\n\nBut the step, which has been under consideration for months, could prove controversial. One concern: Lowering the threshold could drain sparse resources from the public health response to children who need the most help-those with far higher lead levels.\n\nThe CDC did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nExposure to lead-typically in peeling old paint, tainted water or contaminated soil-can cause cognitive impairment and other irreversible health impacts.\n\nThe CDC adjusts its threshold periodically as nationwide average levels drop. The threshold value is meant to identify children whose blood lead levels put them among the 2.5 percent of those with the heaviest exposure.\n\n\"Lead has no biological function in the body, and so the less there is of it in the body the better,\" Bernard M Y Cheung, a University of Hong Kong professor who studies lead data, told Reuters. \"The revision in the blood lead reference level is to push local governments to tighten the regulations on lead in the environment.\"\n\nThe federal agency is talking with state health officials, laboratory operators, medical device makers and public housing authorities about how and when to implement a new threshold.\n\nSince lead was banned in paint and phased out of gasoline nearly 40 years ago, average childhood blood lead levels have fallen more than 90 percent. The average is now around 1 microgram per deciliter.\n\nYet progress has been uneven, and lead poisoning remains an urgent problem in many U.S. communities.\n\nA Reuters investigation published this month found nearly 3,000 areas with recently recorded lead poisoning rates of at least 10 percent, or double those in Flint, Michigan, during that city's water crisis. More than 1,100 of these communities had a rate of elevated blood tests at least four times higher than in Flint.\n\nIn the worst-affected urban areas, up to 50 percent of children tested in recent years had elevated lead levels.\n\nThe CDC has estimated that as many as 500,000 U.S. children have lead levels at or above the current threshold. The agency encourages \"case management\" for these children, which is often carried out by state or local health departments and can involve educating families about lead safety, ordering more blood tests, home inspections or remediation.\n\nAny change in the threshold level carries financial implications. The CDC budget for assisting states with lead safety programs this year was just $17 million, and many state or local health departments are understaffed to treat children who test high.\n\nAnother concern: Many lead testing devices or labs currently have trouble identifying blood lead levels in the 3 micrograms per deciliter range. Test results can have margins of error.\n\n\"You could get false positives and false negatives,\" said Rad Cunningham, an epidemiologist with the Washington State Department of Health. \"It's just not very sensitive in that range.\"\n\nThe CDC doesn't hold regulatory power, leaving states to make their own decisions on how to proceed. Many have yet to adapt their lead poisoning prevention programs to the last reference change, implemented four years ago, when the level dropped from 10 to 5 micrograms per deciliter. Other states, including Virginia and Maine, made changes this year.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is close to adopting a rule requiring an environmental inspection-and lead cleanup if hazards are found-in any public housing units where a young child tests at or above the CDC threshold.\n\nIf the CDC urges public health action under a new threshold, HUD said it will follow through. \"The only thing that will affect our policy is the CDC recommendation for environmental intervention,\" said Dr. Warren Friedman, with HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes.\n\nTo set the reference value, the CDC relies upon data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey. The latest data suggests that a small child with a blood lead level of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter has higher exposure than 97.5 percent of others in the age group, 1 to 5 years.\n\nBut in lead-poisoning hotspots, a far greater portion of children have higher lead levels. Wisconsin data, for instance, shows that around 10 percent of children tested in Milwaukee's most poisoned census tracts had levels double the current CDC standard.\n\nSome worry a lower threshold could produce the opposite effect sought, by diverting money and attention away from children with the worst exposure.\n\n\"A lower reference level may actually do harm by masking reality-that significant levels of lead exposure are still a problem throughout the country,\" said Amy Winslow, chief executive of Magellan Diagnostics, whose blood lead testing machines are used in thousands of U.S. clinics.",

    "title": "Protect Minnesota group takes aim at 'lifetime permit' gun b...",
    "text": "Under Minnesota law, permits expire every five years, at which point applicants must undergo training and pay a fee to renew their permit.\n\nThe new bill, introduced by Rep. Tony Cornish, R-Vernon Center, would establish a one-time permitting system by eliminating expiration dates from carrying permits issued after Aug. 1.\n\n\"It's similar to our firearm safety certificate,\" Cornish said. \"You're given that when you're 11 years old, and you can handle a firearm for the rest of your life and you never have to take another class. Why do we require (renewal) for handguns?\"\n\nThe bill is among gun-related legislation to garner opposition this year from anti-gun violence group Protect Minnesota.\n\nThe group took to the State Capitol Tuesday, Feb. 14 for its Broken Hearts Day event to urge lawmakers to reject bills like lifetime permits, which members called \"extreme.\" The group distributed 1,500 handmade cards to lawmakers, each one representing an incident of gun violence in the last year.\n\nThe Rev. Nancy Nord Bence, Protect Minnesota executive director, said the Cornish bill would hinder law enforcement's ability to remove licenses from people who can no longer safely carry a gun.\n\nThe state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension reported cancelling, revoking or suspending permits from nearly 400 Minnesotans who had previously been approved to carry firearms.\n\nThe bill, she said, also raises concern over Minnesota's aging population, who will become increasingly susceptible to dementia.\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association estimates more than 90,000 Minnesotans over the age of 65 live with Alzheimer's, and the number is expected to grow to 120,000 by 2020.\n\n\"Do we really believe that that person who was safe to carry a gun when they were 21, or 31 or 41 still be totally completely together when they're 91?\" she asked. \"We have a serious issue with our aging population that is well-armed.\"\n\nCornish dismissed concerns from Protect Minnesota, whom he called \"gun-haters.\"\n\nA former police officer who chairs the House Public Safety and Security Committee, Cornish said the initial training and background check would sufficiently vet applicants the first time.\n\nThe lifetime permits holders, he said, could lose their permit if convicted of crimes that would bar them from carrying a handgun.\n\nCornish's bill also aims to lower the cost of legally carrying a firearm by reducing the maximum permit fee counties can charge from $100 to $50.\n\nApplicants currently pay permit fees to counties in addition to the cost for permit to carry classes, which range from about $90 to $150.\n\nAlthough Protect Minnesota estimates the permit fees generate nearly $1 million for the state, Cornish said the process has become unduly expensive for applicants.\n\n\"There's a number of counties who've gotten more money in their pocket from that than they need,\" he said. \"It's not that expensive to do background checks and issue these cards any more.\"\n\nFrom the other side of the aisle, two bills to be reintroduced by Sen. Ron Latz, D-St. Louis Park, and Rep. Dave Pinto, D-St. Paul, next week have gained support from Protect Minnesota.\n\nOne bill would require background checks for any gun purchases made by private sellers in Minnesota. Only licensed retailers now are required to conduct background checks.\n\nThe second Latz-Pinto bill would establish \"red flag laws\" allowing families and law enforcement officers to petition courts to have guns temporarily confiscated from people at risk of hurting themselves or other people.\n\nThe third bill to receive support from Protect Minnesota would allocate state funding into gun violence prevention programs. Sen. Jeff Hayden, D-Minneapolis, will introduce the bill in memory of his sister, who was killed in the crossfire of an Atlanta shooting last summer.\n\n\u2022 Permitless carry bills proposed in both the House and Senate would allow any citizen to carry \"any firearm or self-defense device\" without a permit. A carry permit would would be optional, but not required to carry a handgun. Under this bill, any public official who \"interferes with the right to carry a pistol\" would be subject to misdemeanor charges.\n\n\u2022 A second set of permitless carry bills proposed in the House and Senate would establish a system in which a permit to carry a handgun would be optional, but not required. Permits would not be required to carry a gun in a \"public space,\" which the bill has expanded to include \"property owned, leased, or controlled by a governmental unit and private property that is regularly and frequently open to or made available for use by the public in sufficient numbers.\"\n\nLocations not exempt from the \"public space\" definition include a person's home, place of business or land as well as gun shows or gun shops.\n\n\u2022 A proposed \"stand your ground\" bill would eliminate the obligation to retreat from danger in cases of self-defense by deadly force. For self-defense regarding a person's home, the bill expands the definition of \"dwelling\" to include \"an overnight stopping accommodation of any kind or place of abode.\" This could include porches, boats and cars. The original House bill also gained a companion Senate bill.",

    "text": "BRASILIA - Around 60 people were killed in a bloody prison riot in the Amazon jungle city of Manaus sparked by a war between rival drug gangs, officials said on Monday, Jan. 2, in the worst violence in over two decades in Brazil's overcrowded penitentiary system.\n\nThe head of security for Amazonas state, Sergio Fontes, told a news conference that the death toll could rise as authorities get a clearer idea of the scale of the rebellion sparked by a fight between rival drug gangs.\n\nFontes told reporters that several of the dead had their decapitated bodies thrown over the prison wall - and that most of those killed came from one gang.\n\n\"This was another chapter in the silent and ruthless war of drug trafficking,\" he said.\n\nPedro Florencio, the Amazonas state prison secretary, said that the massacre was a \"revenge killing\" that formed part of an ongoing feud between criminal gangs in Brazil.\n\nThe riot began late Sunday and was brought under control by around 7 a.m. on Monday, Fontes said. Authorities were still counting the prisoners to determine how many had escaped, he added, with reports that up to 300 fled.\n\nJust as the riot began in one unit of the Anisio Jobim prison complex, dozens of prisoners in the second unit started a mass escape in what authorities said was a coordinated effort to distract guards.\n\nOvercrowding is extremely common in Brazil's prisons, which suffer endemic violence and what rights groups call medieval conditions with cells so crowded prisoners have no space to lie down and food is scarce.\n\nThe Anisio Jobim prison complex currently houses 2,230 inmates despite having a capacity of only 590.\n\nWatchdog groups sharply criticize Brazil for its prisons where deadly riots routinely break out.\n\n\"These massacres occur almost daily in Brazil,\" said Father Valdir Silveira, director of Pastoral Carceraria, a Catholic center that monitors prison conditions in Brazil. \"Our prisons were built to annihilate, torture and kill.\"\n\nThe violence was the latest clash between inmates aligned with the Sao Paulo-based First Capital Command drug gang, Brazil's most powerful, and a local Manaus criminal group known as the North Family.\n\nThe Manaus-based gang is widely believed to be attacking PCC inmates at the behest of the Rio de Janeiro-based Red Command drug gang, Brazil's second largest.\n\nSecurity analysts have said that a truce that held for years between the PCC and CV was broken last year, resulting in months of deadly prison battles between the gangs and sparking fears that chaos will spread to other prisons.\n\nIn the latest riot, a group of inmates exchanged gunfire with police and held 12 prison guards hostage late on Sunday in the largest prison in Manaus, an industrial city on the banks of the Amazon River, Globo TV reported.\n\nFontes said that 74 prisoners were taken hostage during the riot, with some executed and some released.\n\nA video posted on the website of the Manaus-based newspaper Em Tempo showed dozens of bloodied and mutilated bodies piled atop each other on the prison floor as other inmates milled about.\n\nBrazil's prison system is precariously overcrowded and conditions in many institutions are horrific. That has sparked a rash of deadly riots in recent years.\n\nSunday's riot was the deadliest in years. A 1992 rebellion at the Carandiru prison in Sao Paulo state saw 111 inmates killed, nearly all of them by police as they retook the jail.\n\nMaria Canineu, director of Human Rights Watch for Brazil, said the most recent violence was the result of \"no government in 20 years giving much attention to the penitentiary system.\"\n\nCanineu said that for years it's been very difficult for states to receiving any funding help from the federal government for prisons.\n\nPresident Michel Temer announced last week that the federal government would furnish states with $366 million, mostly to improve infrastructure and security in existing prisons and to build new ones.",

    "text": "Kingbird was one of about 100 participants who gathered in the parking lot of the John Glas Fieldhouse on Tuesday for Bemidji's first-ever Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women's Walk. Marchers, including men and children, as well as Native American women, united in solidarity with similar events taking place nationwide, hoping to call attention to the disproportionate amount of violence against Native women.\n\n\"We felt that it was very important for us to organize an event for today with the other actions that are happening all over Canada and all over the rest of the United States,\" said organizer Audrianna Goodwin. \"This is a very touching issue for almost all of us in the room ... and we just want to do our part in raising awareness to this issue.\"\n\nParticipants held signs and some wore red shawls during the march from the field house to BSU's Hobson Memorial Union; the group was greeted by honking cars as it traveled along Bemidji Avenue North. Native women and those who had lost family members led the march and allies brought up the rear.\n\nThe event was planned by the Indigenous Environmental Network's women's leadership group Ogimaakwewiwin. Group member Simone Senogles said that while Ogimaakwewiwin only became aware of similar marches last week, they decided to do their best to pull together the Tuesday event.\n\n\"Even though the time was really, really short we knew that it was something we wanted to do, we wanted to at least try,\" Senogles told participants. \"We're really, really humbled and honored by all of you coming out on this cold day and joining us.\"\n\nAfter the march, attendees gathered in the Beaux Arts Ballroom in Hobson. A Planned Parenthood table offered condoms and literature about HIV/AIDS prevention, while Northwoods Battered Women's Shelter and Red Lake shelter Equay Wiigamig also offered information about services. The organizers spoke about violence against Native women both nationwide and locally before jingle dress dancers performed.\n\n\"We want to acknowledge that this is a real issue to people,\" said organizer Anna Goldtooth. \"It affects us everywhere, and in our community we've experienced a lot of violence happening in the past few years against Native women.\"\n\nEach speaker said that much of the violence against indigenous women stems from colonization, even violence within Native communities.\n\n\"This violence that's perpetuated against our women isn't who we are. It never was part of our ways to hurt our women,\" Goodwin said. \"I just can't stress enough that this isn't who we are.\"",

    "title": "ACT UP At 30: Reinvigorated For Trump Fight",
    "text": "Donald Trump's presidency is less than three months old, but in that time there have been massive turnouts for the Women's March, and Tax Day protests in cities across the country demanding that Trump release his returns. This coming Saturday, on Earth Day, scores of March for Science protests are expected.\n\nHelping to guide these actions are veteran activists with the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power - better known as ACT UP. Thirty years after its founding, some seasoned activists are dusting off their bullhorns and updating their direct-action playbooks to tap into the new wave of activism energized by opposition to Trump's policies.\n\nFounded in 1987, ACT UP never settled for trying to push change quietly or behind the scenes.\n\nThey were loud, demanding, and in-your-face with telegenic direct action, a protest that got serious attention and, occasionally, laughs.\n\nLike the time members engulfed the suburban Virginia home of their nemesis, the late Republican Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, in a giant canvas condom that read \"Helms Is Deadlier Than A Virus.\"\n\nOr when ACT UP members posed as news executives and bum-rushed Dan Rather during a live broadcast of the CBS Evening News at the start of the Gulf War.\n\nThen there was the time they stormed the National Institutes of Health, pushing for changes in AIDS research, funding and clinical trials. Over an NIH foyer, activists unfurled a giant banner with their logo and slogan: Silence=Death.\n\nI'm \"the snarky, Machiavellian dude behind the Silence=Death image,\" New York artist and writer Avram Finkelstein says with a chuckle.\n\nThat slogan - black and white with a pink triangle - presaged the formation of the radical AIDS advocacy group ACT UP. The slogan helped change the way the world looked at AIDS. At one point, Silence=Death was the most powerful protest slogan around. It became an iconic backdrop to the group's chant for \"ACT UP, FIGHT BACK, FIGHT AIDS!\"\n\nNow, at 65, Finkelstein is one of several ACT UP veterans from the 1980s and '90s who today is helping shepherd new protesters train and strategize, including the anti-Trump collective Rise and Resist.\n\n\"Many people are younger people who work with organizations that were formed by ACT UP. Or were in ACT UP themselves,\" he says.\n\nHe recently led a teach-in on design and imagery for Rise and Resist.\n\n\"All of the civil disobedience training is being done by the same exact people who did them at ACT UP,\" Finkelstein says. \"So here is this perfect cross-section of this moment. Here is an inter-generational activist organization. And its meetings are in the community center a spitting distance from where the original ACT UP meetings took place.\"\n\nIn January, Rise and Resist took one of its first actions: scores of members booked brunch reservations at restaurants in several Trump-owned properties including Trump Tower. Over eggs Benedict in the crowded eateries, protesters began to cough and cough some more. The \"cough-in\" protesters held up signs saying \"Trumpcare is making us sick.\"\n\n\"That's the kind of mediagenic sort of action that ACT UP used to needle their opponent,\" says filmmaker and writer David France, who's behind the book and film How To Survive A Plague. \"And Trump is an easy target for needling, and they're working on trying to exploit that weakness of his. The more time he spends in the early morning hours fashioning his tweets in response to perceived slights, the less time he has to advance his agenda.\"\n\nFrance and others note the feeling of total powerlessness in the face of Trump and Republican control of Washington echoes the early days of the AIDS crisis.\n\n\"Younger generations, the millennials, and even Gen X and Gen Y, have the sense of never having had power, really,\" France says. \"And it's kind of a learning experience for them to realize that there were times in history when others felt the same, and were yet not dispirited by it, but found a way to plow through it and find that power.\"\n\nACT UP was certainly not immune to internal fissures and strategic stumbles. Some members broke off into subgroups. But ACT UP remained steadfast in its strategy of being bold, persistent and willing to be unpopular to foster change. It's a template Rise and Resist is trying to emulate, France says.\n\n\"I think what they're doing, especially at Rise and Resist, is taking those tactics and strategies and bringing them to the modern era, and making them appropriate for the particular struggles being faced today,\" he says.\n\nGrassroots anger at president Trump's policies has galvanized protesters on the left, including many new to political action.\n\nWhile ACT UP is best known for its direct action protests, the group's potency came from a clear-eyed strategy and its well-organized committees, says Maxine Wolfe - another veteran gay rights activist from ACT UP's earliest days, who is now involved in Rise and Resist.\n\nACT UP had committees on health, research, PR, housing, and more. They did their homework, Wolfe says, and helped ACT UP create a potent \"inside-outside\" strategy: demanding a seat of power alongside politicians and big pharma while keeping pressure up through creative street protests. The strategy helped turn HIV from a death sentence to a manageable condition.\n\n\"We had a women's committee, a people of color committee, the treatment and data committee,\" Wolfe recalls. \"We lobbied peoples, we did civil disobedience. The idea there was that you could use not a huge number of people but a varied playbook,\" she says. \"And [you] would keep coming at it until we won. Which we did.\"\n\nWhat's not clear just a few months into Trump's presidency is what tactics and actions by Trump \"resistors\" will actually have an impact on public opinion and policy. There are sharp tactical disagreements within the inchoate grassroots opposition to Trump's policies over what might prove most effective and sustainable.\n\nGo with massive rallies or small direct actions? Focus on urban population centers or the rural and suburban swing areas that helped elect Trump?\n\nThere are ongoing Trump boycott efforts such as Grab Your Wallet as well as get-off- the couch group Run For Something.\n\n\"It's the movements that are willing to take risks and willing to do bold action over time that are the most successful,\" says writer and activist L.A. Kauffman, author of Direct Action: Protest and the Reinvention of American Radicalism.\n\n\"Obviously you can't stay in crisis mode and at a fever pitch for year after year after year,\" she adds, \"but I see a lot of people recognizing that this is the long haul. What the movements are doing together is creating a crisis for the Trump administration, and in so doing, managing to slow down some of the worst of the harm.\"\n\nWhile ACT UP's activism centered on an array of complex issues, the central focus of HIV and AIDS was a unifying and organizing force. But anger at Trump is broad, diffuse and across a range of issues from health care to climate change.\n\n\"It's a different animal, there's not one single thing to organize against,\" Wolfe says. \"What we need is how to sustain focus. You can't just do one action, let's say, against (senior presidential adviser Steve) Bannon. You have to do many such actions.\"\n\n\"We know now that nominally democratic governments don't have to listen to social protests,\" says activist and writer Micah White, who helped launch the Occupy Wall Street protests. \"You can get 4 million people into the streets and there is no requirement in our Constitution or in our laws that the president has to listen. He's able to say, 'Thanks. Now go home.' And they go home.\"\n\nWhite now advocates a rural, Internet-enabled progressive movement where activists get elected to local offices and prove they can govern.\n\n\"As social protesters, we need to stop with this na\u00efve belief that if we just get more people into the streets, then we'll get what we want. It's not true!\" White says.\n\nFinkelstein notes that he did not come up with the Silence=Death logo quickly on the back of a napkin one night over a beer. It was, he says, a deliberative, iterative process with five friends that took about six months to produce.\n\nHe's not against big marches like January's massive Women's March in cities across America and the world, or the upcoming Earth Day March for Science.\n\nBut his lesson from creating the iconic ACT UP logo: there's tremendous power in smaller actions that can reverberate in unexpected ways.\n\n\"If that million people were broken into small groups of four and five, think of the power that could have,\" Finkelstein says. \"Pussy Riot was four people with a boombox, and it totally changed the way we thought about Putin's administration.\"\n\nRise and Resist and several other anti-Trump groups are still groping, in these early days, with what tactics might have a real impact with a famously media-savvy mogul turned president, who may be thin-skinned, but knows how to punch back.\n\n\"A lot of super smart people that I know are so distracted by the scorching lava flow of Trump's campaign, and now his first days in office, that they seem to be unable to think strategically about it,\" Finkelstein says. \"That surprises me, frankly. The toolbox for doing so is right in front of us.\"",

    "title": "In Germany, Churchgoers Are Encouraged To Tweet From The Pews",
    "text": "In Germany this year, the Protestant church is celebrating 500 years since Martin Luther brought about the Reformation. Today, as the number of churchgoers dwindles, the clergy is turning to new media to appeal to those with little time to attend worship in person.\n\nIn the eastern city of Magdeburg, the monotone peal of a single church bell calls a modest flock of parishioners to evening prayers at the Walloon Reformed Church of St. Augustine.\n\nAs the faithful file into a High Gothic church where Martin Luther once delivered a sermon, most fumble around in handbags and pockets, looking for their cellphones.\n\nBut instead of dutifully switching off their phones and putting them away on this Friday evening, these 40 or so churchgoers take a pew and bow their heads over their lit-up devices as if they were prayer books.\n\nThis is a Twitter service, where the congregation is encouraged to tweet about the liturgy and share their prayers online.\n\nPastor Ralf Peter Reimann says it's an experiment. He believes that social media can help the Protestant church retain and even gain followers, even in today's increasingly secular society.\n\n\"There are lots of people who live online,\" he says. \"We want to include these people and offer them to participate in a way that's comfortable to them.\"\n\nWhile Reimann preaches from behind the lectern, a chorus of young parishioners perching in the choir stalls tweets about his sermon. Above them, a large screen displays a hash-tagged feed which, in real time, shows tweets coming from both within the church and from around Germany.\n\n\"Luther talked about the priesthood of all believers,\" Reimann says. \"So if you use social media, it's not only the pastor communicating on behalf of the church, but Christians communicating among each other.\"\n\nAlthough such Twitter services are yet to catch on, embracing the latest media trend is nothing new for Protestants.\n\nFive-hundred years ago, when Martin Luther first protested against corruption in the Catholic Church, it was the then relatively new printing press that helped his challenge to papal authority to \"go viral.\"\n\nLuther's supporters printed his radical ideas in pamphlets. Cheap to produce and easy to distribute, these pamphlets fostered public debate.\n\nUlrike Zitzlsperger, a professor of German studies at the University of Exeter in England, says the 16th century pamphlet was the social media of Luther's day.\n\n\"I think the parallels with the use of Twitter today are really strong,\" Zitzlsperger says. \"You've got a topic that engages not just an educated public but really the wider public, the lay people. Everybody has a say.\"\n\nLuther's followers shared these pamphlets and responded to them by printing their own. These Twitter-like discussions spread so rapidly that the Catholic Church could do little to censor what it called heresy.\n\nToday though, it's no longer dissent but disinterest that threatens the Christian church in Europe.\n\nBack in Magdeburg, the Twitter service is in full swing. Messages from around Germany, where dozens of others participated, are displayed on the church's interactive screen in front of the altar.\n\nSome posts are encouraging, like the one from a Twitter user who tweets in German, \"We all make mistakes. God will show us the right way.\"\n\nSome users share their private prayers, like one who posts: \"I pray for the unborn child in my belly and that it is blessed with good health.\"\n\nOther users are less convinced. \"Sorry, this is too hectic,\" one writes. \"I go to church to find inner peace. I'm signing off.\"\n\nIt's also too much for 86-year-old Ingeborg Brunner, who tiptoes out of church before the Twitter service is over. Brunner doesn't own a smartphone, so she feels somewhat left out.\n\n\"It was certainly interesting, but it's not my cup of tea\" Brunner admits. \"I'm a little old for Twitter. I prefer a proper service, when we get to sing hymns.\"\n\nWhile Brunner says she's pleased the church is appealing to the digitally devout, regular churchgoers like her would rather sing than tweet.\n\nAfter all, congregational singing is another major legacy of the Reformation.",

    "title": "In Portugal, Drug Use Is Treated As A Medical Issue, Not A Crime",
    "text": "Gandelina Dami\u00e3o, 78, is permanently hunched, carrying her sorrow. She lost three children to heroin in the 1990s.\n\nA quarter century ago, her cobblestone lane, up a grassy hill from Lisbon's Tagus River, was littered with syringes. She recalls having to search for her teenagers in graffitied stone buildings nearby, where they would shoot up.\n\n\"It was a huge blow,\" Dami\u00e3o says, pointing to framed photos on her wall of Paulo, Miguel and Liliana. \"I was a good mother. I never gave them money for drugs. But I couldn't save them.\"\n\nFor much of the 20th century, Portugal was a closed, Catholic society, with a military dictator and no drug education. In the early 1970s, young Portuguese men were drafted to fight wars in the country's African colonies, where many were exposed to drugs for the first time. Some came home addicted.\n\nIn 1974, there was a revolution - and an explosion of freedom.\n\n\"It was a little bit like the Americans in Vietnam. Whiskey was cheaper than water, and cannabis was easy to access. So people came home from war with some [drug] habits,\" says Jo\u00e3o Goul\u00e3o, Portugal's drug czar. \"Suddenly everything was different [after the revolution]. Freedom! And drugs were something that came with that freedom. But we were completely naive.\"\n\nBy the 1990s, 1 percent of Portugal's population was hooked on heroin. It was one of the worst drug epidemics in the world, and it prompted Portugal's government to take a novel approach: It decriminalized all drugs. Starting in 2001, possession or use of any drug - even heroin - has been treated as a health issue, not a crime.\n\nGoul\u00e3o, who had worked as a family physician in his 20s, at the height of the crisis, says there was very little opposition to the policy change.\n\n\"Every family had its own drug addict. It was so, so present in everyday life, that it turned public opinion,\" Goul\u00e3o says. \"We are dealing with a chronic relapsing disease, and this is a disease like any other. I do not put a diabetic in jail, for instance.\"\n\nUnder the 2001 decriminalization law, authored by Goul\u00e3o, drug dealers are still sent to prison. But anyone caught with less than a 10-day supply of any drug - including heroin - gets mandatory medical treatment. No judge, no courtroom, no jail.\n\nInstead they end up in a sparsely furnished, discreet, unmarked office in downtown Lisbon, for counselling with government sociologists, who decide whether to refer them to drug treatment centers.\n\n\"It's cheaper to treat people than to incarcerate them,\" says sociologist Nuno Cabaz. \"If I come across someone who wants my help, I'm in a much better position to provide it than a judge would ever be. Simple as that.\"\n\nCabaz's team of 10 counselors handles all of Lisbon's roughly 2,500 drug cases a year. It may sound like a lot, but it's actually a 75 percent drop from the 1990s. Portugal's drug-induced death rate has plummeted to five times lower than the European Union average.\n\nAlong a row of abandoned buildings in northern Lisbon, field psychologists took NPR to meet some of Portugal's remaining drug users. The hillside is littered with needles, and bursting with wildflowers. The sky rumbles with airliners landing at the international airport nearby.\n\nThere's a philosophy book on a cement stoop next to a middle-aged man who's smoking crack cocaine. He gives his name as Rui, and says the stigma against addicts has eased since decriminalization.\n\n\"Now, not so much. It's less, because the methadone is coming, and people are treating this problem,\" he says. \"They see the drugs with another perspective.\"\n\nEvery day, a government van pulls up and gives him a dose of methadone, an opioid that helps wean people off of heroin. It's a step toward harm-reduction. He still does cocaine, but no longer shoots up.\n\nDrug-related HIV infections in Portugal have dropped 95 percent.\n\nDrug workers hand out packets with clean needles and condoms, and listen to another addict, Antonio, describe his anxiety.\n\n\"If the drugs hurt too much my body, I escape a little, and then I come back again,\" he says. \"But it's a world I cannot escape! If I turn there, it's there - it's everywhere. I cannot escape.\"\n\nFor every person in Portugal who cannot escape addiction, there's daily methadone, counseling and free treatment. A generation ago, these addicts were put in jail. Now they're on the street.\n\nBut polls show the Portuguese - having lived through the ravages of a heroin epidemic - overwhelmingly support this policy.",

    "title": "Schools Will Soon Have To Put In Writing If They 'Lunch Shame'",
    "text": "Every day in this country students come to school without a way to pay for lunch. Right now it's up to the school to decide what happens next.\n\nSince new legislation out of New Mexico on so-called lunch shaming made headlines - we've heard a lot about how schools react.\n\nSome provide kids an alternative lunch, like a cold cheese sandwich. Other schools sometimes will provide hot lunch, but require students do chores, have their hand stamped or wear a wristband showing they're behind in payment. And, some schools will deny students lunch all together.\n\nWith policies to handle unpaid meals all over the map, the USDA, which administers the federal school meal program, will soon require that all school districts have a policy on what to do when kids can't pay - a growing problem. By July 1, those policies must be in writing and communicated to staff, parents and the community.\n\n\"We're saying feed these children first, and let the grownups sort out the finances,\" says Jennifer Ramo, who's with the anti-hunger group, New Mexico Appleseed. About nine years ago she says she started hearing stories about kids receiving a tray of food only to have it tossed out by a cafeteria worker when they realized students didn't have the money to pay.\n\nSeeing the need, Ramo worked with New Mexico state Sen. Michael Padilla to write the state law banning schools from shaming children without the ability to pay for meals.\n\n\"A lot of people are very disgusted by this practice and they're reaching out - calling their own state senators and state representatives and asking them to get on it immediately,\" says Sen. Padilla. Since the bill became law earlier this month, he says lawmakers from around the country have reached out to see how they can address the same issues where they are.\n\nTexas and California are already working on similar legislation. California Democratic state Sen. Robert Hertzberg introduced the Child Hunger Prevention and Fair Treatment Act.\n\n\"When I presented the bill, the two Republican senators on the committee joined as co-authors. How great is that? It just tells you this is not a partisan issue. It's a basic fundamental human issue everybody gets,\" he says.\n\nThe School Nutrition Association found about 75 percent of districts had some unpaid student meal debt at the end of the last school year. Part of the challenge is that students who qualify for free or reduced priced meals through the federal school lunch program, aren't signed up. The law in New Mexico aims to deal with that fact.\n\nJennifer Ramo says her state law is leading the way. Perhaps the timing couldn't be better. She says she's confident that because districts must now put their debt policies in writing, they will get much more scrutiny.\n\n\"I'm hoping communities really put pressure on their own districts to say, 'We want our children fed,'\" she says.",

    "title": "Men, Listen Up: Women Like The Smell Of Guys Who Eat A Certain Diet",
    "text": "What we eat can influence more than our waistlines. It turns out, our diets also help determine what we smell like.\n\nA recent study found that women preferred the body odor of men who ate a lot of fruits and vegetables. Whereas men who ate a lot of carbohydrates gave off a smell that was less appealing.\n\nSkeptical? At first, I was, too. I thought this line of inquiry must have been dreamed up by the produce industry. (Makes a good marketing campaign, right?!)\n\nBut it's legit. \"We've known for a while that odor is an important component of attractiveness, especially for women,\" says Ian Stephen of Macquarie University in Australia. He studies evolution, genetics and psychology and is an author of the study.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, scientists say our sweat can help signal our health status, and could possibly play a role in helping attract a mate.\n\nSo, how did scientists evaluate the link between diet and the attractiveness of body odor?\n\nThey began by recruiting a bunch of healthy, young men. They assessed the men's skin using an instrument called a spectrophotometer. When people eat a lot of colorful veggies, their skin takes on the hue of carotenoids, the plant pigments that are responsible for bright red, yellow and orange foods.\n\n\"The carotenoids get deposited in our skin,\" explains Stephen. The spectrophotometer \"flashes a light onto your skin and measures the color reflected back,\" says Stephen. The results are \"a good indicator of how much fruits and vegetables we're eating,\" he says.\n\nStephen and his colleagues also had the men in the study compete food frequency questionnaires, so they could determine the men's overall patterns of eating. Then, men were given clean T-shirts and asked to do some exercise.\n\nAfterwards, women in the study were asked to sniff the sweat. (Note: The methodology was much more scientific and precise than my breezy explanation, but you get the picture!) \"We asked the women to rate how much they liked it, how floral, how fruity,\" and a bunch of other descriptors, explains Stephen.\n\nIt's a small study, but the results were pretty consistent. \"Women basically found that men who ate more vegetables smelled nicer,\" Stephen told us.\n\nMen who ate a lot of meat did not produce a sweat that was any more - or less - attractive to women. But meat did tend to make men's odor more intense.\n\n\"This is not the first study to show that diet influences body odor,\" says George Preti, an adjunct professor in the dermatology department at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia.\n\nA study published in 2006 found that women preferred the odor of men who ate a non-meat diet, \"characterized by increased intakes of eggs, cheese, soy, fruit and vegetables.\"\n\nBut Preti points out that the relationship between diet and body odor is indirect.\n\nSome people think if they eat a garlic or onion - or a piece of meat - they will smell like that food. \"But that's not what happens,\" Preti says. Your breath might smell like the food you eat, but not your sweat.\n\nBody odor is created when the bacteria on our skin metabolize the compounds that come out of our sweat glands.\n\n\"The sweat doesn't come out smelly,\" Preti explains, \"It must be metabolized by the bacteria that live on the surface of the skin.\"\n\nNow, of course, at a time when good hygiene and deodorant use are commonplace, is the smell of our sweat a big concern?\n\nI put that question to the happy-hour crowd at a bar down the street from the NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I'm pretty OK with my smell,\" Stefan Ruffini told me. That evening he was ordering a burger on a bun and a side of fries, along with a beer. When I told him about the findings of the study, he laughed it off.\n\n\"I've got a girlfriend, so I don't worry about these things!\"he said.\n\nThe study did not assess diet and odor attractiveness among same-sex couples.\n\n\"As a lesbian, I haven't smelled a man in several years,\" Stacy Carroll, who was also at happy hour, told me. \"I eat a lot of produce, I have a girlfriend, so it's working out!\"\n\nCarroll says people who eat a lot of fruits and vegetables are more likely to be interested in their health --\"feeling good, looking fit\" - than their smell.",

    "text": "A rally to save the Confederate monument in Travis Park was met by counterprotesters in support of removing the memorial last Saturday.\n\nThe mostly peaceful events in San Antonio coincided with violent demonstrations the same day in Charlottesville, Virginia stemming from a similar debate about the removal of a statue of Robert E.

    "title": "Its Survival In Doubt, Sears Struggles To Transform Once Again",
    "text": "A century ago, it was one of the biggest names in retail. Now, even Sears officials say its future could be in doubt - though they say they have plans to make sure the retail icon survives.\n\nNancy Koehn with the Harvard Business School says in its early days - Sears Roebuck and Co. was like Amazon is today - a retailer of great disruption.\n\nFor Sears, it meant a path-breaking strategy of offering all sorts of merchandise in catalogs and building department stores in remote places with ample parking.\n\n\"It wasn't the Internet, but it was the same idea that no matter where you are you can touch and feel and imagine what these different products could mean in your life by virtue of an outreach, a distribution channel that an imaginative and gutsy retailer - in this case Sears - had created and then invested in and then enlarged,\" Koehn says.\n\nElgin, Ill., about 40 miles northwest of Chicago, is one town where Sears' innovation is clearly visible. Drive through the streets of one neighborhood and more than likely there will be a Sears Roebuck mail order kit house on one of the lots.\n\nDr. Rebecca Hunter, an architectural historian, stands on the porch of one of them - an arts and crafts style bungalow listed as \"The Osborne\" in the Sears catalog. It's one of about 200 Sears homes in Elgin.\n\n\"It's a phenomenon that gained popularity in the 1920s,\" Hunter says. \"Mostly your framing boards were cut at the mill and numbered so that your builder would know how to put them together.\"\n\nBetween 1908 and 1940, Sears sold blueprints and approximately 70,000 pre-cut kit houses. It was a small part of the company's booming business. Sears' stature is far smaller these days amid a constantly changing retail landscape which brought with it the dominance of Amazon, the rise of e-commerce and big-box discount retailers.\n\nIt's left brick-and-mortar stores reeling. Despite its merger with Kmart in 2005, Sears has consistently lost millions of dollars each quarter.\n\nThe retailer has closed hundreds of stores, slashed jobs and sold off key assets like the Lands' End clothing line and its legendary Craftsman brand - although both brands continue to be sold at Sears. Independent retail analyst Sucharita Mulpuru says these changes haven't worked.\n\n\"There are just so many onerous forces relating to competition,\" she says. \"I think that no matter what they do, they are fighting a losing battle.\"\n\nIn a memo, CEO Eddie Lampert says Sears is taking decisive action to return to profitability and to become a new kind of retailer. Some analysts accuse Lampert of sucking the value out of the company, selling off its most marketable assets. Then there's that line in Sears' recent annual report to federal regulators - which states \"substantial doubt exists related to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\"\n\nBut Leena Munjal, a Sears senior vice president in charge of retail operations, says that reports of the company's demise are exaggerated.\n\n\"Do we have challenges? Absolutely,\" she says. \"Just like many of the retailers out there and we are all trying to figure out what are the changes we need to make to our business models to be able to rise to those challenges.\"\n\nSears' transformation plan includes a membership program called Shop Your Way. Customers collect points they can redeem when they shop at Sears. The company's also worked on ways to make it more convenient for customers to shop online, or on their phones.\n\nThe Sears at Woodfield Mall, about 30 miles northwest of Chicago, is huge. There are clothes, fitness equipment and aisles of gleaming appliances. Carla and Jeremy Lang push their twin 18-month-old sons in a stroller while looking at ovens and stoves. Carla Lang says they've heard about the store's financial troubles.\n\n\"We've read stuff online that they may be closing stores and what not, but we still come here,\" she says. \"It's close by, and like I said we've had success with purchasing things.\"\n\nThere are others though, loyal past shoppers, who haven't been in a Sears for years. Susan Mullen has fond memories of the store, but says she's not sure Sears' efforts to transform itself will work.\n\n\"It fits no niche. It's not a discount place. It's not high end,\" Mullen says. \"It has no identity anymore. I guess it tried to be everything to everybody and it was very successful at that. But now it's nothing to nobody, which is sad.\"\n\nBut Munjal says that as a company with more than $20 billion in sales, Sears is still important to many and she invites former customers to give the company another chance while it implements changes. It's all part of the effort to counter the predictions of a slow death for Sears, while bolstering the reputation of a company that's been in business for more than a century.",

    "title": "Charlottesville Rally Aimed To Defend A Confederate Statue. It May Have Doomed Others",
    "text": "On Saturday, white supremacists converged on Charlottesville, Va. to protest the pending removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Their stated goal: to \"take America back\" - and to begin doing so by saving Lee's monument, which has become a lightning rod since the local city council voted to remove it earlier this year.\n\nWithin hours, three people had died in the chaos surrounding the gathering - one of whom was rammed by a car allegedly driven by a rally attendee.\n\nAnd within three days, politicians in a number of cities, far from protecting their own Confederate monuments, had instead moved to hasten their removal. In Baltimore and Jacksonville, Fla., in Memphis and Lexington, Ky., local leaders acted to begin getting rid of these long-standing landmarks.\n\n\"Mayors are on the razor's edge. When you see the tension. When you see the violence that we saw in Charlottesville,\" Lexington Mayor Jim Gray told a local CBS affiliate, \"then you know that we must act.\"\n\nHe said Sunday he has recommended to the city council that the statues depicting Confederate officers John C. Breckinridge and John Hunt Morgan be relocated to a new site where they would stand side by side with with \"two monuments to the Union effort.\" In their current location, the Confederate monuments stand on land that formerly played host to one of the South's largest slave auction blocks.\n\n\"It's just not right that we would continue to honor these Confederate men who fought to preserve slavery on the same ground as men, women and even children were once sold into a life of slavery,\" Gray said in a video statement. \"Relocating these statues and explaining them is the right thing to do.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Memphis, city leaders re-asserted their longstanding resistance to Confederate monuments on public land, promising again to fight for those statues' removal. State lawmakers have required that these memorials could only be moved with a waiver from the Tennessee Historical Commission, which has previously rejected the city's attempts to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest.\n\n\"What Nathan Bedford Forrest stood for doesn't express the views of this community at this time,\" City Attorney Bruce McMullen told the local Commercial Appeal, \"and it's counterproductive to what we want this community to be, and that is an inclusive community working together.\"\n\nAlong with the still-pending waiver application to have Forrest's statue removed, McMullen told the paper the city plans to apply for a waiver to pull a monument to Confederate President Jefferson Davis from a park.\n\nIn Baltimore, too, Mayor Catherine Pugh said Monday that she had reached out to contractors to discuss relocating the city's four monuments to the Confederacy, according to The Baltimore Sun.\n\nThe city council president in Jacksonville, Fla., said Monday she is preparing a plan to relocate its Confederate monuments \"from public property to museums and educational institutions where they can be respectfully preserved and historically contextualized.\" Elsewhere in Florida, in Gainesville, construction workers took down a 113-year-old Confederate statue Monday morning.\n\n\"There was no riot. No protesters showed up,\" The Gainesville Sun reported.\n\nSome protesters did not even wait for city leaders. In Durham, N.C., shouting demonstrators pulled down a monument to Confederate soldiers, kicking it after it fell to the ground.\n\nIn all, \"at least 1,500 symbols of the Confederacy can be found in public spaces across the country, mostly in the Deep South,\" the Southern Poverty Law Center noted in a report last year. \"Most were put in place during the early decades of Jim Crow or in reaction to the civil rights movement.\"\n\nAnd many of them remain flashpoints of controversy between those who wish to see them removed and those who see them as crucial markers of their community's past.\n\nAs for Lexington, Gray said the relocation of his city's monuments would enable residents to \"tell the story accurately and share a truthful history.\"\n\n\"It's true that hiding our history won't allow our future generations to learn and avoid the same mistakes,\" Gray said. \"But keeping monuments to those who fought to preserve slavery on this hallowed ground is simply not right.\"",

    "text": "A Denver jury found fully in pop singer Taylor Swift's favor Monday, delivering a unanimous verdict in a trial over whether she was groped by a former radio host during a Denver meet-and-greet. Wanting the trial to serve as an \"example to other women,\" the star had sought a single dollar in damages, which she was granted.\n\nIn his closing statements, Swift's lawyer Douglas Baldridge referenced the example that Swift hoped her suit could be for others in similar situations \"by returning a verdict on Ms. Swift's counterclaim for a single dollar - a single symbolic dollar, the value of which is immeasurable to all women in this situation.\"\n\nIn his own closing arguments, David Mueller attorney Gabriel McFarland wondered why his client would introduce himself by name and then almost immediately after reach under the skirt of \"one of the planet's, one of the country's, biggest superstars?\"\n\nThe case was largely fought on the credibility of Swift and Mueller.\n\nLate this past Friday, a federal judge threw out part of the case brought against Swift by Mueller, saying he had not proven Swift had set out to get him fired.\n\nSwift countersued Mueller for sexual assault after his own suit was filed in 2015, leading to Denver trial which began jury selection last Monday. Swift initially had sought to keep the incident quiet.\n\nBy Friday, most of the principals in the case had been heard from - most notably Ms. Swift herself, who had several sharp rejoinders to questions from Mueller's attorney. Asked about Mueller's firing, Swift responded: \"I am not going to allow your client to make me feel like it is anyway my fault, because it isn't.\"",

    "title": "White Supremacist Site Is Banned By GoDaddy After Virginia Rally",
    "text": "The Daily Stormer, a Neo-Nazi website that promoted the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Va., will no longer be hosted by GoDaddy, after the service received calls to ban the site over its hate-filled stories.\n\nThe Daily Stormer is now seen as trying to spin the threat of being taken down, with the site posting a story that claims to be written by hackers affiliated with the activist group Anonymous. That story includes a threat to delete the site within 24 hours. But a main source of news about Anonymous says the group doesn't seem to be involved.\n\nThe dispute over the website comes after a violent weekend in Charlottesville culminated in the killing of Heather Heyer, 32, an anti-white nationalist protester. Police say James Alex Fields Jr., 20, killed Heyer when he drove his car into a crowd of people.\n\nThe Daily Stormer then published a story mocking Heyer and making light of the events in Virginia, prompting calls for GoDaddy, which hosts the site, to be taken down.\n\nPosting a link to the offending story, women's rights advocate Amy Siskind\u200f wrote via Twitter, you host The Daily Stormer - they posted this on their site. Please retweet if you think this hate should be taken down & banned.\"\n\nMore than 6,500 people retweeted that message, and the web service replied late Sunday night, \"We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service.\"\n\nIn the story on the Daily Stormer, the purported hackers say they'll delete the site by the same deadline set by GoDaddy. But in a break with notable hacking takeovers, the story doesn't appear as a message plastered on the front of the site; instead, it's published alongside other pieces, including the one about Heyer.\n\nThe Daily Stormer is published by Andrew Anglin, who also writes much of its most high-profile content; the site is supported by reader donations rather than by advertising.\n\nThe alleged hackers' message included the hashtag #TANGODOWN - a term that was quickly used by opponents of the site's views to celebrate its seeming demise. News organizations around the world ran stories about the apparent takeover, which had included the explanation, \"this evil cannot be allowed to stand.\"\n\nBut a Twitter account that often relays news about Anonymous states, \"We have no confirmation that 'Anonymous' is involved yet. Looks more like a DS stunt. Wonder if they are having issues finding a new host.\"\n\nReferring to the all-caps message posted on the site - about an elite team targeting Anglin and his site - the account states, \"We find claim that it took a 'UNITED FORCE OF ELITE HACKERS' to hack a CMS run by amateurs incredibly amusing.\"\n\nPeople commenting on the Daily Stormer site also found the situation amusing, noting that the supposed hackers had said they had located Anglin and would be \"sending our allies in Lagos to pay him a visit in person.\"\n\n\"LOL, this meme just won't end,\" one person wrote about the Lagos reference.\n\nEarlier this year, Anglin's website was linked to an office in Worthington, Ohio, the Columbus suburb where he went to high school. As Columbus Alive reported, \"Anglin's current whereabouts remain unknown.\"\n\nThe most popular response on the comment board was one that mocked people on Twitter who had announced the Daily Stormer had been taken over.\n\n\"Anglin you are a legend,\" one person wrote.",

    "title": "Mexico Catches One Of Several Fugitive Former Governors After A Half-Year Hunt",
    "text": "When Javier Duarte stepped down from office last October, the former governor of Mexico's Veracruz state vowed to fight the mounting corruption allegations that unraveled his tenure.\n\n\"The circumstances created by false accusations ... force me to dedicate myself full-time to clear my name and that of my family,\" Duarte said on Oct. 13, according to The Yucatan Times, just one day after he ended his term six weeks early.\n\nIt would be another half-year before the he surfaced - this time in handcuffs, escorted from his hotel at a lakeside resort in Guatemala on Saturday night. Authorities say he had been squirreled away in a hotel room with his wife, attempting to pass as a tourist.\n\nNow he is in a prison cell in Guatemala City, awaiting his widely expected extradition back to Mexico, where Reuters reports he'll face allegations that he diverted public funds for his personal enrichment. That includes a luxury ranch - packed with paintings by masters such as Joan Miro and Leonora Carrington, the BBC reports - that authorities say was paid for by siphoned dollars.\n\nDuring his roughly six years in office, Duarte's Gulf Coast state also earned the inglorious distinction of becoming \"one of the world's most lethal regions for the press,\" according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The CPJ estimated last year that at least 12 journalists were murdered during Duarte's tenure; other organizations have placed that number even higher.\n\nA 2012 dispatch from CPJ correspondent Mike O'Connor explains the atmosphere that took shape under Duarte:\n\n\"Veracruz is a beautiful, long, thin state on the Gulf coast of Mexico where many journalists are terrified not only of the rampant organized crime groups that kill and control, but also of the state government. Fear that state officials will order them murdered for what they investigate or write has forced about a dozen journalists to flee the state, claiming that fear also puts a clamp on coverage for those who remain.\"\n\nAnd that's not to mention the mass grave discovered outside Veracruz city last month that contained 252 bodies, many of which are believed to have been buried years ago.\n\nStrikingly, Duarte's allegation-plagued tenure was by no means uncommon. The politician isn't the only former Mexican governor to draw prosecutors' attention - nor was he the only former leader in his own party, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, to go on the lam for an extended period.\n\nFormer Tamaulipas Gov. Tom\u00e1s Yarrington was caught in Florence, Italy, just last week after five years on the run. U.S. prosecutors have alleged he \"accepted millions of dollars in drug cartel bribes and invested it in Texas real estate,\" according to The Associated Press. And The Wall Street Journal, citing orders issued by state police, says that Yarrington had been assigned eight law enforcement officers as bodyguards as late as last year.\n\nMeanwhile former Chihuahua Gov. Cesar Duarte - no relation - has still eluded authorities after he stepped down last year. Once a rising star in the PRI like Javier Duarte (who was suspended from the party around the time of his disappearance) and Yarrington, Cesar Duarte is being pursued over embezzlement charges.\n\nAll of this makes for a rather persistent problem for the party's leader, Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who has been battling historically terrible approval ratings.\n\nSo it's not too much of a surprise that, as the AP reports, the PRI cheered the capture of the former Veracruz governor, who the party said should \"be punished in an exemplary fashion, as well as anyone who is confirmed to have taken part in his criminal ring.\"\n\nStill, it will do little to erase the rather unexemplary records of many governors across Mexico - and not just those in the PRI. The Duartes have plenty of company.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times breaks it down: In a country of 31 states and one federal district, nearly a dozen governors recently out of office are on the lam, under investigation or already in prison.",

    "title": "In The Rockies, Climate Change Spells Trouble For Cutthroat Trout",
    "text": "There's an unplanned experiment going on in the northern Rocky Mountains. What's happening is that spring is arriving earlier, and it's generally warmer and drier than usual. And that's messing with some of the fish that live there.\n\nThe fish is the iconic cutthroat trout. It's a native North American fish that thrives in cold, small streams. Explorer Meriwether Lewis of Lewis and Clark Expedition fame was among the first European-Americans to catch this spangly, spotted fish. He used deer spleen as bait.\n\nIt's relative rarity now makes it a favorite for catch-and-release anglers. But biologists have now found that it's in danger. The much more common rainbow trout is invading cutthroat streams and mating with the native fish. Ecologist Clint Muhlfeld says that creates hybrids.\n\n\"It jumbles up the genes that are linked to the locally adapted traits that these fish have evolved with,\" says Muhlfeld, who's with the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of Montana's Flathead Lake Biological Station.\n\nThose traits have allowed cutthroats to survive through millennia in cold northern streams. And cold streams were thought to protect them from rainbows, which prefer warmer water.\n\nBut climate change is warming many high-altitude streams, and they frequently have less water, another change that favors rainbows. So they're moving in.\n\nMuhlfeld says that when rainbows and cutthroats breed, the resulting hybrids are feeble - \"less fit,\" in biological terms. \"They don't survive as well as the native fish,\" he says. And hybrids that do survive continue to make more hybrids; there's no going back to making cutthroats again.\n\nWriting in the journal Global Change Biology, Muhlfeld and a team of scientists from several research institutions studied fish in hundreds of locations in the northern Rockies. Hybridization was widespread. It was most common in places where fish and game departments have introduced rainbow trout, a practice that goes back to the 19th century.\n\nSome states are trying to solve the problem by getting rid of rainbow trout. That might not please some anglers, but Muhlfeld says the cutthroat species could disappear otherwise.\n\n\"There are so many places around the world where you can go catch a rainbow trout,\" he says; it's been introduced all over the world. \"There's very few places where you can actually go and catch a native fish that's been around for thousands and thousands of years.\n\n\"Extinction is permanent. Once the native genomes and adaptive traits are gone, they are gone forever.\"",

    "text": "Here's what we've been told about passwords:\n\nUse numbers, question marks and hash marks.\n\nUse different passwords for each app and website.\n\nOf course, these guidelines often leave users frustrated and struggling to remember them all.\n\nNow, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is about the make all of our lives much easier. The organization recently revised its guidelines on creating passwords, and the new advice sharply diverges from previous rules.\n\n\"The traditional guidance is actually producing passwords that are easy for bad guys and hard for legitimate users,\" says Paul Grassi, senior standards and technology adviser at NIST, who led the new revision of guidelines.\n\nThe organization suggests keeping passwords simple, long and memorable. Phrases, lowercase letters and typical English words work well, Grassi tells NPR's Audie Cornish. Experts no longer suggest special characters and a mixture of lower and uppercase letters. And passwords never need to expire.\n\n\"We focus on the cognitive side of this, which is what tools can users use to remember these things?\" Grassi says. \"So if you can picture it in your head, and no one else could, that's a good password.\"\n\nWhile these rules may seem suspiciously easy, Grassi says these guidelines help users create longer passwords that are harder for hackers to break. And he says the computer security industry in both the public and private sectors has received these new rules positively.\n\n\"It works because we are creating longer passwords that cryptographically are harder to break than the shorter ones, even with all those special character requirements,\" Grassi says. \"We are really bad at random passwords, so the longer the better.\"\n\nPreviously, security experts recommended the use of password manager apps to ensure users' accounts were protected. Grassi says these apps are useful because they completely randomize the password, but he says they aren't necessary to maintain security.\n\nGrassi stands by these new guidelines because he says previous tips for passwords impacted users negatively and did not do much to boost security. When users change their passwords every 90 days, they often aren't dramatically changing the password, Grassi says.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure you're not changing your entire password; you're shifting one character,\" he says. \"Everyone does that, and the bad guys know that.\"",

The city funds come with requirements that Hulu create 500 jobs over three years, 70 percent of which within in a year must make 15.68 per hour and include medical benefits. Hulu is also expected to make an investment of 13 million dollars into the property. Mayor Ivy Taylor says it is a good deal for the city for more than just those 500 jobs.\n\n\"I think it certainly can lead to much more because Hulu is a growing company, but also just the cache that comes with a company like that being here could lead similar companies to give San Antonio fair consideration,\" says Taylor.\n\nBexar County is offering $403,000 in a 10-year, 90 percent rebate. This deal would include the same 500 job requirement. It also expects a 15 million dollar investment in the company's Viewer Experience Operations headquarters. Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff agrees that Hulu is great for building the local tech industry.\n\n\"So, we're really beginning to grow this industry. Now Hulu gives us another avenue to be able to sell other companies to come here. And that's important because they look at whose here,\" he says.\n\nThe county votes Tuesday to authorize city staff to begin negotiations, with the above as its opening offer. City council votes on their final deal on Thursday.",

    "title": "Once Routine, ICE Check-Ins Now Fill Immigrants In U.S. Illegally With Anxiety",
    "text": "Florinda Lorenzo has been in the U.S. illegally for more than a decade but checks in with federal immigration agents in Baltimore several times a year. Until recently, it had become routine, almost like a trip to the dentist.\n\nMany immigrants - like Lorenzo - who are here illegally are not in hiding. Hundreds of thousands of them report to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on a regular basis. They've been allowed to stay because past administrations considered them a low priority for deportation.\n\nBut with the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, that once-routine check-in has become a nerve-wracking experience. In recent weeks, some immigrants say they've been detained without warning at their ICE check-ins.\n\n\"It creates a lot of chaos for me,\" Lorenzo says through an interpreter. \"I know lots of people are getting deported now, and I wouldn't want to be deported.\"\n\nLorenzo came to the U.S. from Guatemala 14 years ago. She has three children, two of them U.S. citizens who were born here. Lorenzo was arrested in 2010 and charged with selling prepaid phone cards without a license. The charges were dropped, but she's been required to check in with ICE since then.\n\nBefore her most recent appointment earlier this month, Lorenzo looked nervous. Her eyes were red.\n\n\"It's hard for my family, for me ... my kids, my husband,\" Lorenzo says. \"It's very painful and stressful for me. ... I just hope I go back to my children today.\"\n\nA few dozen friends gathered to pray and show their support - both for Lorenzo's sake, and for ICE officials, in case they were watching. Nick Katz, a lawyer with CASA de Maryland, an immigrant advocacy group, accompanied Lorenzo to provide legal help in case she was detained.\n\n\"The environment is so uncertain,\" Katz says. \"We've heard stories of people being taken into custody. We know of at least one mother who was taken into custody out of a check-in.\"\n\nAcross the U.S., judges have issued final removal orders for more than 900,000 people in the country illegally. Many remain as long as they check in regularly with ICE.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, they were not considered priorities for deportation because they had clean criminal records, or strong ties to their communities. The Trump administration, however, is taking a more aggressive enforcement stance.\n\nPresident Trump signed executive orders that broadly expanded the number of people who are priorities for deportation. That category now includes many immigrants whose only offense may be entering or staying in the country illegally.\n\nHans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, applauded the move. Von Spakovsky says criminals should be the priority. But, he says, that doesn't mean everyone else should get a free pass.\n\n\"You're in the United States illegally; you broke the law to come here illegally,\" von Spakovsky says. \"And the government agency is basically saying, 'That's OK, we're not going to do anything about it.' That just to me is a complete violation of the rule of law.\"\n\nAn ICE spokeswoman did not respond to questions about the check-ins.\n\nSeveral cases of unauthorized immigrants being detained at their ICE appointments have gotten widespread attention. That could have unintended consequences, says Alonzo Pena, who served as deputy director of ICE in the Obama administration. If agents detain large numbers of immigrants at their check-ins, he says, other immigrants may decide it's too risky to report.\n\n\"It's going to send a bad message to others, and it's going to really backfire,\" Pena says. \"They lose faith in the system ... and you don't know where they're at.\n\n\"There's nothing good that will come out of that,\" he says.\n\nLorenzo emerges from her appointment in the ICE field office with a smile on her face.\n\n\"I feel very happy right now. ... My heart isn't as heavy anymore,\" Lorenzo says. \"I don't have the words, but I feel relief.\"\n\nLorenzo found out that she can stay, at least for a few more months. She doesn't have to check in with ICE again until October. But neither Lorenzo nor her lawyers can say what will happen when she does.",

    "title": "Trump Calls Out KKK, White Supremacists After Charlottesville: 'Racism Is Evil'",
    "text": "Almost 48 hours after violence engulfed Charlottesville, Va., President Trump called out white nationalist groups by name. Trump's remarks on Monday followed criticism that his initial statement about the clash of protesters did not condemn racist groups specifically.\n\n\"Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,\" the president said from the White House.\n\nTrump began his remarks talking about his economic accomplishments and plans for trade negotiations before turning his attention to the events over the weekend in Virginia. After the Charlottesville City Council had voted earlier this year to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from one of its parks, white nationalist groups - including white supremacists, the alt-right, the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis - descended on the city for a \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\nOn Friday night, they marched on the normally sleepy college town, home to the University of Virginia, carrying torches. On Saturday conditions turned deadly as hundreds of the white nationalists, some carrying Confederate flags and shields and others in militia-like gear, clashed with counterprotesters in the city streets.\n\nAt one point a silver Dodge Challenger, allegedly driven by 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. of Ohio, rammed into a street filled with counterprotesters. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed, and at least 19 others were injured. Fields was charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit and run.\n\nPresident Trump expressed sympathy to Heyer's family as well as to the families of Virginia State Troopers Lt. H. Jay Cullen and Berke M.M. Bates, who died when their helicopter that was patrolling Saturday's event crashed.\n\n\"These three fallen Americans embody the goodness and decency of our nation,\" Trump said. \"In times such as these, America has always shown its true character, responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice.\"\n\nTrump spoke after meeting with newly installed FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the White House. He said that the Department of Justice had opened a civil rights investigation into the car attack.\n\n\"To anyone who acted criminally at this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be delivered,\" the president said.\n\nSessions told ABC News on Monday morning that the car crash that had killed Heyer \"does meet the definition of domestic terrorism.\"\n\n\"You can be sure we will charge and advance the investigation towards the most serious charges that can be brought, because this is unequivocally an unacceptable, evil attack,\" he said.\n\nThe president's condemnations may be too little, too late for those who criticized Trump's initial remarks - and Trump may have missed a critical moment to be the nation's healer in chief. On Saturday, Trump claimed that the clashes were a result of \"hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.\" Top Republicans, among others, quickly criticized him for not calling out by name the white supremacists, alt-right, KKK and neo-Nazi groups that began the protests.\n\n\"Mr. President - we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism,\" Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who heads up the GOP Senate campaign committee, tweeted on Saturday.\n\nThe White House put out an unsigned statement on Sunday morning, saying that, \"The President said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred and of course that includes white Supremacists, KKK, neo-nazi and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.\"\n\nVice President Pence had gone further than the president in his own comments, telling reporters Sunday night while traveling in Colombia, \"We have no tolerance for hate and violence from white supremacists, neo-Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms.\"\n\nTrump has been blamed for being slow to criticize white supremacist groups in the past - even as he regularly attacks other targets on Twitter. During the 2016 campaign, Trump came under fire for not immediately disavowing the endorsement of David Duke, a former KKK grand wizard.\n\nDuke, who attended the march in Virginia, said on Saturday that participants' aim was \"to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That's what we believed in. That's why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he's going to take our country back.\"\n\nDuke later responded to one of the president's tweets condemning the violence by saying, \"I would recommend you take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency, not radical leftists.\"",
