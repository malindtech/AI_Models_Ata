    "text": "LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart.\n\nDetails of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps.\n\nHis agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch.\n\nDespite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.\n\nWatch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest » .\n\nThe Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year.\n\nHe will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage.\n\nEarlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: \"I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.\n\nAll rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.",

    "title": "Mentally ill inmates in Miami are housed on the \"forgotten floor\"",
    "text": "Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events.\n\nHere, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill.\n\nAn inmate housed on the \"forgotten floor,\" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial.\n\nMIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the \"forgotten floor.\" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court.\n\nMost often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually \"avoidable felonies.\" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police.\n\nMentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman.\n\nSo, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail.\n\nHe is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill.\n\nEven though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.\n\nAt first, it's hard to determine where the people are.\n\nImagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like.\n\nThey're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves.\n\nThat's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses.\n\nLeifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill.\n\nSo, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor.\n\nOf course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud.\n\nWe see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. \"I am the son of the president.\n\nYou need to get me out of here!\" one man shouts at me.\n\nHe is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House.\n\nLeifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges.\n\nIt's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami.\n\nOver a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients.\n\nLeifman says 200 years ago people were considered \"lunatics\" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them.\n\nThey were just considered unfit to be in society.\n\nOver the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals.\n\nBut Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down.\n\nThey became, in many cases, the homeless, he says.\n\nLeifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals.\n\nThe judge says he's working to change this.\n\nStarting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the \"forgotten floor\" will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment.\n\nLeifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start.\n\nLeifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution.\n\nThe patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again.",

    "title": "NEW: NFL chief, Atlanta Falcons owner critical of Michael Vick's conduct .",
    "text": "(CNN) -- The National Football League has indefinitely suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick without pay, officials with the league said Friday.\n\nNFL star Michael Vick is set to appear in court Monday.\n\nA judge will have the final say on a plea deal.\n\nEarlier, Vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Virginia. \"Your admitted conduct was not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible.\n\nYour team, the NFL, and NFL fans have all been hurt by your actions,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a letter to Vick.\n\nGoodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over.\n\nIn papers filed Friday with a federal court in Virginia, Vick also admitted that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not fight well.\n\nFalcons owner Arthur Blank said Vick's admissions describe actions that are \"incomprehensible and unacceptable.\" The suspension makes \"a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the NFL will not be tolerated,\" he said in a statement.\n\nGoodell said the Falcons could \"assert any claims or remedies\" to recover $22 million of Vick's signing bonus from the 10-year, $130 million contract he signed in 2004, according to The Associated Press.\n\nVick said he would plead guilty to one count of \"Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Fighting Venture\" in a plea agreement filed at U.S.\n\nThe charge is punishable by up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, \"full restitution, a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release,\" the plea deal said.\n\nFederal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines. \"The defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense,\" the plea agreement said.\n\nIn an additional summary of facts, signed by Vick and filed with the agreement, Vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs, but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won. \"Most of the 'Bad Newz Kennels' operations and gambling monies were provided by Vick,\" the official summary of facts said.\n\nGambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators Tony Taylor, Quanis Phillips and sometimes Purnell Peace, it continued. \"Vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights.\n\nVick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by 'Bad Newz Kennels.' \" Vick also agreed that \"collective efforts\" by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs.\n\nAround April, Vick, Peace and Phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at Vick's property in Virginia, the statement said. \"Peace, Phillips and Vick agreed to the killing of approximately 6-8 dogs that did not perform well in 'testing' sessions at 1915 Moonlight Road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods, including hanging and drowning. \"Vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of Peace, Phillips and Vick,\" the summary said.\n\nPeace, 35, of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, Georgia; and Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Virginia, already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences.\n\nVick, 27, is scheduled to appear Monday in court, where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge.\n\nSee a timeline of the case against Vick » .\n\nThe judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement.\n\nThe federal case against Vick focused on the interstate conspiracy, but Vick's admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges, according to CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \"It sometimes happens -- not often -- that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior,\" Toobin said Friday. \"The risk for Vick is, if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea, the state of Virginia could say, 'Hey, look, you admitted violating Virginia state law as well.\n\nWe're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court.' \" In the plea deal, Vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary.\n\nVick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests.\n\nVick agreed to \"make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated\" with the dogs that are being held by the government. \"Such costs may include, but are not limited to, all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case, including if necessary, the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals.\" Prosecutors, with the support of animal rights activists, have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs.\n\nBut the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against Vick and his admitted co-conspirators.\n\nHudson issued an order Thursday telling the U.S.\n\nMarshals Service to \"arrest and seize the defendant property, and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property.\" Both the judge's order and Vick's filing refer to \"approximately\" 53 pit bull dogs.\n\nAfter Vick's indictment last month, Goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the Falcons training camp, and the league is reviewing the case.\n\nBlank told the NFL Network on Monday he could not speculate on Vick's future as a Falcon, at least not until he had seen \"a statement of facts\" in the case.",

    "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Dressed in a Superman shirt, 5-year-old Youssif held his sister's hand Friday, seemingly unaware that millions of people across the world have been touched by his story.\n\nNearby, his parents talked about the new future and hope they have for their boy -- and the potential for recovery from his severe burns.\n\nHe's wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims.\n\nIt's the best birthday present the Iraqi family could ever have imagined for their boy: Youssif turns 6 next Friday. \"I was so happy I didn't know what to do with myself,\" his mother, Zainab, told CNN, a broad smile across her face. \"I didn't think the reaction would be this big.\" His father said he was on the roof of his house when CNN called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son. \"We just want to thank everyone who has come forward,\" he said. \"We knew there was kindness out there.\" Like his wife, he couldn't stop smiling.\n\nHe talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in Baghdad, leaving \"no stone unturned\" on a mission to help his boy.\n\nThere were many trips to the Ministry of Health.\n\nHe says he even put in a request to Iraq's parliament for help.\n\nThe family eventually told CNN their story -- that Youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on January 15, doused in gasoline and set on fire.\n\nSimply by coming forward, his parents put themselves in incredible danger.\n\nNo one has been arrested or held accountable in Youssif's case.\n\nWatch CNN's Arwa Damon describe 'truly phenomenal' outpouring » .\n\nShortly after Youssif's story aired Wednesday, the Children's Burn Foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in Sherman Oaks, California, that provides support for burn victims locally, nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for Youssif and his family to come to the United States and to set up a fund for donations.\n\nYou can make a donation at the foundation's site by clicking here.\n\nThere's a drop-down menu under the \"general donation\" area that is marked \"Youssif's fund.\" The foundation says it will cover all medical costs -- from surgeries for Youssif to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him.\n\nPeter Grossman, a plastic surgeon with the affiliated Grossman Burn Center who is donating his services for Youssif's cause.\n\nOfficials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for the family's travels. \"We are prepared to have them come here, set them up in a housing situation, provide support for them and begin treatment,\" said Barbara Friedman, executive director of the Children's Burn Foundation. \"We expect that the treatment will be from between six months to a year with many surgeries.\" She added, \"He will be getting the absolute best care that's available.\" Youssif's parents said they know it's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in America may not be easy.\n\nBut none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost. \"I will do anything for Youssif,\" his father said, pulling his son closer to him. \"Our child is everything.\" His mother tried to coax Youssif to talk to us on this day.\n\nBut he didn't want to; his mother says he's shy outside of their home.\n\nThe biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave, and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in Iraq.\n\nBut this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that January day -- has new hope in the world.\n\nThat is partly due to the tens of thousands of CNN.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act.\n\nCNN Iraqi staff central to bringing this story together were also overwhelmed with the generosity coming from people outside of their border.\n\nIn a nation that largely feels abandoned by the rest of the world, it was a refreshing realization.\n\nCNN.com senior producer Wayne Drash contributed to this report in Atlanta.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- White House press secretary Tony Snow, who is undergoing treatment for cancer, will step down from his post September 14 and be replaced by deputy press secretary Dana Perino, the White House announced Friday.\n\nWhite House press secretary Tony Snow will step down from his post on September 14.\n\nPresident Bush told reporters Friday that he will \"sadly accept\" Snow's resignation.\n\nFlanked by Snow and Perino in the White House press room, the president spoke warmly of his departing press secretary. \"It's been a joy to watch him spar with you,\" Bush told reporters.\n\nWatch the announcement about Snow leaving » .\n\nBush said he was certain of two things in regard to Snow. \"He'll battle cancer and win,\" Bush said, \"and he'll be a solid contributor to society.\" Turning to Snow, the president then said: \"I love you, and I wish you all the best.\" Snow, speaking after Bush at the start of the daily White House news conference, said he was leaving to earn more money.\n\nHe took a big pay cut, he said, when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for Fox News.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Snow makes $168,000 as the White House spokesman.\n\nHis family took out a loan when he started the job, \"and that loan is now gone.\" \"This job has really been a dream for me, a blast.\n\nI've had an enormous amount of fun and satisfaction,\" Snow said.\n\nHe said he would continue to speak out on issues, and would do \"some radio, some TV, but I don't anticipate full-time anchor duties.\" Snow said he's received great satisfaction from talking to people about his illness.\n\nSnow's cancer was diagnosed for the first time in February 2005.\n\nHis colon was removed, and after six months of treatment, doctors said the cancer was in remission.\n\nPerino announced March 27 that Snow's cancer had recurred, and that doctors had removed a growth from his abdomen the day before.\n\nSources told CNN two weeks ago that Snow was planning to leave his job, possibly as early as September.\n\nBush tapped Snow to replace Scott McClellan in April 2006.\n\nSnow had been an anchor for \"Fox News Sunday\" and a political analyst for the Fox News Channel, which he joined in 1996.\n\nHe also hosted \"The Tony Snow Show\" on Fox News Radio.\n\nOn Thursday, Snow told CNN his health is improving, citing two medical tests this month that found the cancer has not spread. \"The tumors are stable -- they are not growing,\" Snow said of the results from an MRI and a CAT scan. \"And there are no new growths.\n\nThe health is good.\" The press secretary, whose hair has turned gray during chemotherapy treatment, said his black hair is expected to grow back in about a month. \"I'm also putting on weight again,\" he said after returning from a 10-day vacation. \"I actually feel very good about\" the health situation.\n\nSnow said on Friday he was to see his oncologist, and they will decide on some minor forms of chemotherapy to start as maintenance treatment.",

    "title": "President Bush to address the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Wednesday .",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As he awaits a crucial progress report on Iraq, President Bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to Vietnam by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out.\n\nPresident Bush pauses Tuesday during a news conference at the North American Leaders summit in Canada.\n\nOn Wednesday in Kansas City, Missouri, Bush will tell members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that \"then, as now, people argued that the real problem was America's presence and that if we would just withdraw, the killing would end,\" according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by the White House. \"Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left,\" Bush will say. \"Whatever your position in that debate, one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like 'boat people,' 're-education camps' and 'killing fields,' \" the president will say.\n\nThe president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility, citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam, according to the excerpts. \"Here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently,\" Bush will say.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, \"President Bush's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two.\n\nOur nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses, leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history. \"While the President continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in Iraq, paid for by the taxpayers, American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government.\n\nIt is time to change direction in Iraq, and Congress will again work to do so in the fall.\" The White House is billing the speech, along with another address next week to the American Legion, as an effort to \"provide broader context\" for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen.\n\nDavid Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad.\n\nPresident Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his troop \"surge\" in Iraq until the report comes out in September.\n\nWatch Bush criticize the Iraqi government » .\n\nIt is being closely watched on Capitol Hill, particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war.\n\nEarlier this month, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq might begin.\n\nBush's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the White House to try to reframe the debate over Iraq, as public support for the war continues to sag.\n\nA recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war, and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress, it won't change their opinion.\n\nThe poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq.\n\nIn addition to his analogy to Vietnam, Bush in Wednesday's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from Asia, including the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s, according to the excerpts. \"In the aftermath of Japan's surrender, many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy.\n\nThen, as now, the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom,\" Bush will say. \"Today, in defiance of the critics, Japan ... stands as one of the world's great free societies.\" Speaking about the Korean War, Bush will note that at the time \"critics argued that the war was futile, that we never should have sent our troops in, or that America's intervention was divisive here at home.\" \"While it is true that the Korean War had its share of challenges, America never broke its word,\" Bush will say. \"Without America's intervention during the war, and our willingness to stick with the South Koreans after the war, millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There is \"no remaining hope\" of finding six men trapped for almost a month in a Utah coal mine alive, a federal official said Saturday.\n\nIsaac Arellano holds a candle and sings during a fundraiser for miners Tuesday in Price, Utah. \"Over the past 25 days, the Mine Safety and Health Administration has exhausted all known options in our attempt to reach the six miners,\" Richard Stickler, head of the agency, said in a statement. \"The thoughts and prayers of the dedicated professionals at MSHA are with the families.\" Sympathy for the failed efforts also came Saturday from the White House. \"Last night, a difficult decision was made to end the search,\" President Bush said in a statement. \"Laura and I are deeply saddened by this tragedy and continue to pray for the families of these men.\" Labor Secretary Elaine Chao called the ordeal \"heartbreaking.\" \"The grueling around-the-clock rescue operation that claimed three lives and injured six others has also taken a tremendous toll on the many brave rescuers and the local community, and our thoughts and prayers are with them all,\" Chao said in a statement.\n\nAfter drilling seven holes into mine tunnels from the mountaintop above, there has been no sign of the miners -- and microphones have picked up no sound from the men.\n\nTests showed underground oxygen levels were too low to sustain human life. \"We basically told the families that at this point in time we've run out of options,\" Stickler said at a news conference late Friday. \"We've consulted with the people that we have here, we've consulted with the technical support in Pittsburgh and we've consulted with private consultants in terms of where we can go,\" he said. \"And basically, through all the information we've gleaned over the past nearly four weeks in terms of the conditions we found, in terms of the air readings we found down there and ... everything else, we just don't know where else we can put a hole to get any other information.\" See photos of the rescue mission » .\n\nThere were no public statements Saturday from Bob Murray, president and CEO of Murray Mining, co-owner of the Crandall Canyon Mine, who was the outspoken face of the rescue operation for the first three weeks, then largely disappeared from public view.\n\nNo one from Murray Mining was present at Friday's news conference. \"They are done.\n\nIt's finished,\" the attorney for the families said, according to the Saturday edition of The Salt Lake Tribune. \"It's a hard and bitter pill for our families, and there were quite a few tears shed,\" the newspaper quotes Colin King as saying.\n\nThe men were trapped during a collapse on August 6, and it is not known whether they survived the cave-in.\n\nEfforts to reach them were suspended 10 days later when two rescuers and a federal mining official were killed, and six people were injured in a second collapse as they tried to tunnel horizontally toward the area where the men had been working.\n\nMurray said last week that the search effort would stop if no signs of life were found at the sixth hole.\n\nUnder pressure from the families, however, he agreed to try one more time.\n\nFamilies wanted officials to drill a hole large enough to send down a rescue capsule.\n\nThe effort to lower the robotic device down a seventh hole had been called \"a long shot\" by an official.\n\nMSHA's Stickler said that hole was drilled into the Crandall Canyon Mine on Thursday, but there were problems with a robotic camera that teams were trying to lower into it.\n\nWork resumed Friday, this time at the fourth hole, but the camera could only descend about 7 feet, he said. \"Basically, what it saw was really not that much.\n\nThere was quite a bit of mud in there, water coming down the hole.\n\nIt really couldn't go any farther than seven feet,\" he said of the latest try.\n\nIn addition, the roof was sagging. \"The families asked many, many questions and we answered them all the best we could, basically coming to the conclusion that we had run out of options.\" Murray said last Saturday he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Crandall Canyon mine. \"I will never come back to that evil mountain,\" he said.\n\nFriends and family have identified the six missing miners as Luis Hernandez, Manuel Sanchez, Kerry Allred, Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips and Don Erickson.",

    "title": "Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees .",
    "text": "(CNN) -- A virus found in healthy Australian honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across the United States, researchers reported Thursday.\n\nHoney bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the Bee Research Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland.\n\nColony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees -- up to 90 percent of colonies in some U.S. beekeeping operations -- imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination, such as oranges, blueberries, apples and almonds.\n\nDepartment of Agriculture says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $15 billion worth of crops each year in the United States.\n\nMore than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination.\n\nSigns of colony collapse disorder were first reported in the United States in 2004, the same year American beekeepers started importing bees from Australia.\n\nThe disorder is marked by hives left with a queen, a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food, but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone.\n\nThe virus identified in the healthy Australian bees is Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) -- named that because it was discovered by Hebrew University researchers.\n\nAlthough worker bees in colony collapse disorder vanish, bees infected with IAPV die close to the hive, after developing shivering wings and paralysis.\n\nFor some reason, the Australian bees seem to be resistant to IAPV and do not come down with symptoms.\n\nScientists used genetic analyses of bees collected over the past three years and found that IAPV was present in bees that had come from colony collapse disorder hives 96 percent of the time.\n\nBut the study released Thursday on the Science Express Web site, operated by the journal Science, cautioned that collapse disorder is likely caused by several factors. \"This research give us a very good lead to follow, but we do not believe IAPV is acting alone,\" said Jeffery S.\n\nDepartment of Agriculture's Bee Research Laboratory and a co-author of the study. \"Other stressors on the colony are likely involved.\" This could explain why bees in Australia may be resistant to colony collapse. \"There are no cases ... in Australia at all,\" entomologist Dave Britton of the Australian Museum told the Sydney Morning Herald last month. \"It is a Northern Hemisphere phenomenon.\" Bee ecology expert and University of Florida professor Jamie Ellis said earlier this year that genetic weakness bred into bees over time, pathogens spread by parasites and the effects of pesticides and pollutants might be other factors.\n\nResearchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the U.S. mainland but are not found in Australia.\n\nDelaplane said Thursday the study offers a warning -- and hope. \"One nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind,\" said Delaplane, who has been trying to breed bees resistant to the varroa mite. \"But in the case of IAPV, there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder.\n\nThis is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease- and pest-resistant.\" Bee researchers will now look for stresses that may combine to kill bees. \"The next step is to ascertain whether IAPV, alone or in concert with other factors, can induce CCD [colony collapse disorder] in healthy bees,\" said Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.\n\nBesides the Columbia and USDA researchers, others involved in the study released Thursday include researchers from Pennsylvania State University, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, the University of Arizona and 454 Life Sciences.",

    "text": "LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- Former football star O.J.\n\nSimpson will be held without bail after his arrest on robbery and assault charges, police announced late Sunday.\n\nSimpson is accused of having directed several other men in an alleged armed robbery of sports memorabilia in a room at a Las Vegas hotel room.\n\nLas Vegas authorities said they have no information leading them to believe Simpson was carrying a firearm during the alleged incident at the Palace Station Hotel and Casino.\n\nPolice said Simpson and other men burst into the room and walked out with the memorabilia, including some that was unrelated to Simpson, police said. \"We don't believe that anyone was roughed up, but there were firearms involved,\" Lt.\n\nNichols said the firearms were pointed at the victims.\n\nA reporter asked Nichols: Was \"O.J. was the boss in that room?\" Nichols responded, \"That is what we believe, yes.\" Watch Simpson transferred Sunday in handcuffs » .\n\nThe alleged victims were identified as Bruce Fromong, a sports memorabilia collector who described the incident as \"a home invasion-type robbery,\" and Alfred Beardsley, who has been quoted by celebrity Web site TMZ.com as saying that Simpson later apologized to him and told him he regretted the incident.\n\nActing on a tip, police met over the weekend at McCarran International Airport with 46-year-old Walter Alexander, of Mesa, Arizona, who told them about the alleged robbery and validated the tipster's information, Capt.\n\nAlexander was arrested Saturday night on two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a deadly weapon.\n\nHe was released on his own recognizance and returned to Mesa either Saturday night or early Sunday morning, Dillon said.\n\nIn addition, investigators are seeking four other men they believe accompanied Simpson into the hotel room, Nichols said.\n\nNichols said, \"There is a social relationship between the individuals that we identified and O.J.\n\nSimpson.\" Though Simpson is not accused of having brandished a gun himself, two firearms that police said were used were recovered early Sunday in one of three searches.\n\nInvestigators would would not divulge where the weapons were found.\n\nNichols dismissed an initial report that the men may have been off-duty police. \"There is no truth to that whatsoever,\" he said. \"That came as a result of some language that was used when the individuals burst into the room that led our victims to believe that they may have been police.\" Simpson, 60, has acknowledged taking some items that belonged to him, but he has denied that any weapons were involved. \"Whether the property belonged to Mr.\n\nSimpson or not is still in debate,\" Nichols said. \"We are still in the process of sorting that out.\" Nichols also said that some of the property taken had Simpson's signature.\n\nBut \"there was some other property taken as well,\" he said. \"I believe there were some Joe Montana cleats and some signed baseballs and other stuff.\" The latest charges against Simpson mean he faces the prospect of another prosecution, more than a decade after the June 1994 stabbing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman.\n\nSimpson was acquitted of murder the following year.\n\nThe trial riveted much of the United States.\n\nBut in 1997, a jury found him liable for the deaths in a civil case brought by the Goldman family.\n\nSimpson was ordered to pay the families a total of $33.5 million for the deaths .\n\nGoldman had gone to Nicole Simpson's Los Angeles home to return a pair of glasses the day of the slayings.\n\nGoldman's sister, Kim Goldman, said she wasn't surprised by the robbery allegations, since Simpson \"thinks he can do no wrong.\" \"He's capable of stabbing people to death, so I think robbery is nothing surprising,\" she said. \"Normal, logical, civil-minded, law-abiding people don't storm a room with guns demanding stuff back.\" Fromong had testified on Simpson's behalf in the civil case, telling the court that prices for Simpson memorabilia had dropped substantially since the 1995 verdict.\n\nHis testimony was part of the defense's contention that Simpson could not afford to pay the Goldmans.\n\nSimpson recently wrote a book originally titled \"If I Did It\" and had planned to publish it himself, but a public outcry led to the cancellation of his book deal.\n\nA bankruptcy judge subsequently awarded the Goldmans the rights to the book in light of their inability to collect the wrongful death award.\n\nThe Goldmans retitled the book, \"If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer.\" That book just hit bookstores.",

    "title": "NEW: Indictment: Man tried to pass nuclear filters to foreign agent .",
    "text": "(CNN) -- A former government contract employee was indicted on charges of stealing restricted nuclear energy-related materials and putting the United States at risk, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.\n\nSources say the classified materials were taken from the East Tennessee Technology Park.\n\nRoy Lynn Oakley, 67, of Roane County, Tennessee, appeared in federal court in Knoxville on Thursday.\n\nOakley was briefly detained for questioning in the case in January, when authorities first learned of the alleged plot to divulge the materials, government sources told CNN.\n\nHe voluntarily surrendered Thursday at an FBI field office in Knoxville, the sources said.\n\nOakley is a former employee of Bechtel Jacobs, the Department of Energy's prime environmental management contractor at the East Tennessee Technology Park, prosecutors said.\n\nThe indictment states that Oakley, \"having possession of, access to and having been entrusted with sections of 'barriers' and associated hardware used for uranium enrichment through the process of gaseous diffusion ... having reason to believe that such data would be utilized to injure the United States and secure an advantage to a foreign nation, did communicate, transmit and disclose such data to another person.\" The transfer took place January 26, the indictment alleges.\n\nOakley is also charged with converting the material and \"restricted data\" to his own use.\n\nHe began doing so on about October 17, 2006, and continued through January, prosecutors said.\n\nProsecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them.\n\nOakley's attorney, Herb Moncier, said outside court Thursday that Oakley's job was to break rods \"into little pieces\" and throw them away.\n\nMoncier said Oakley had a security clearance, but Moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance.\n\nThe government alleges that in January, Oakley attempted to sell the \"pieces of scrap\" to someone he thought was a French agent -- but in reality was an undercover FBI agent, Moncier said.\n\nHe said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an \"appliance\" under the law. \"Mr.\n\nOakley has cooperated fully for the last six months,\" said Moncier, who added that he had traveled to Washington for work on the case.\n\nEach count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. \"While none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization, the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands,\" Kenneth Wainstein, assistant attorney general for national security, said in the Justice Department statement.\n\nOne government source said the materials involved are not the \"crown jewels,\" but they should not have been taken from the facility.\n\nA \"barrier\" is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process, according to nuclear energy officials, but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job.\n\nSources told CNN that federal authorities have been following Oakley and investigating the case for at least six months, after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material.\n\nOakley, described as a low-level employee, apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind, an official familiar with the case said.\n\nA government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of Oakley's alleged intentions six months ago, the FBI and Department of Energy launched a joint investigation.\n\nThe FBI then developed a sting operation, government officials familiar with the case said, and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country.\n\nEast Tennessee Technology Park is an area of the DOE's Oak Ridge reservation \"where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985,\" Gerald Boyd, manager of the DOE's Oak Ridge site office, said Thursday. \"When they were in use, now over 20 years ago, some of the buildings at ETTP housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium.\" Boyd said the technology park and the reservation \"are protected by multiple layers of security systems and detection programs, both visible and unseen, meant to identify rogue employees attempting to abuse their access and position.\" In this case, a review of security procedures showed that the system worked and \"successfully identified the individual in question,\" he said.\n\nCNN's Terry Frieden and Kelli Arena contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Organ shortage in rich states has created a trade from poorer countries .",
    "text": "HONG KONG, China (Reuters) -- Paul Lee got his liver from an executed Chinese prisoner; Karam in Egypt bought a kidney for his sister for $5,300; in Istanbul Hakan is holding out for $30,700 for one of his kidneys.\n\nDoctors in Pakistan have been arrested for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys.\n\nThey are not so unusual: a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with end-stage illnesses to poorer places like China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Colombia and the Philippines to buy a new lease of life.\n\nLee, a 53-year-old chief subway technician in Hong Kong, was diagnosed with liver cancer in January 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread.\n\nA friend told him about a transplant hospital in China's north eastern Tianjin city and he signed up for a place.\n\nThat April, he paid 260,000 yuan ($34,380) for a transplant -- surgery that saved his life. \"The hospital has connections with a lot of prisons,\" Lee told Reuters. \"Mine came from an executed prisoner from Heilongjiang.\n\nI thank the donor deeply.\" The World Health Organization estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually, but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90,000.\n\nDemand for kidneys also exceeds supply, and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and \"transplant tourists\" who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living.\n\nA donor in South Africa receives $700 for a kidney compared with $30,000 in the United States.\n\nA lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on, or at least regulate, the trade.\n\nBut even where the trade is banned, laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes, which are sometimes defended by vested interests.\n\nAnd the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient.\n\nAny transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor -- especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donor's liver.\n\nThe complications can include bleeding, infection, even death.\n\nIn the transplant trade, the recipient need not worry about, for example, exposing a living relative to that risk. \"It is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you don't have to care for someone you don't know.\n\nOnce you pay, it is discarded in a way, it is dispensable,\" said Luc Noel, a Geneva-based coordinator for Clinical Procedures at the World Health Organization.\n\nChina recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners, saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year.\n\nOnly 20,000 transplants are carried out in China each year.\n\nOf these, 3,000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors.\n\nChina defended its use of organs from executed prisoners, saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families.\n\nA transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around $33,000 in China. \"What is important is the transparency, it has to be open to scrutiny ... if China makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent, that would do good,\" said the WHO's Noel.\n\nIn Asia, a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs.\n\nExcluding China, Asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year, said Lo Chung-man, professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nPakistan, where trade in human organs is not illegal, is turning into a \"kidney bazaar\", said the chief executive of Pakistan's Kidney Foundation, Jaffar Naqvi.\n\nThere are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but Naqvi said there were 13 centers in Lahore alone which reported more than 2,000 transplants last year from bought kidneys.\n\nPatients, mostly from Europe, Saudi Arabia and India, pay about 500,000 rupees ($8,500) for a new kidney, he said.\n\nDonors are paid $300 to $1,000 and often get no medical care after the surgery.\n\nIn May police arrested nine people, four of them doctors, for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations.\n\nIn the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade, but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a non-relative, with no payment.\n\nSuch a clause allowing \"altruistic\" organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors, Naqvi said.\n\nStories of people selling their organs, especially kidneys, are not uncommon in Egypt, where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line.\n\nKaram, who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal, said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure.\n\nHe said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30,000 Egyptian pounds ($5,300). \"The fees of the doctor were 5,000 pounds.\n\nBoth his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the 'donor' received,\" said Karam.\n\nHe said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients' lists.\n\nAbdel-Kader Hegazy, head of the disciplinary committee at the Doctors' Union, said Egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants, making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence. \"The law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment.\n\nWe at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices, but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back,\" he told Reuters. \"It is an annoying and a regrettable situation.\n\nThey are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values.\" The union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants, with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities.\n\nBut the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years because of differences between doctors and senior Muslim religious leaders on whether Islam allows organ transplants in the case of clinical deaths.\n\nIn Turkey, students, unemployed young men and struggling fathers post adverts on the Internet selling their kidneys, listing their drinking and smoking habits and blood type.\n\nThese would-be donors say they have had enquiries from Germany, Israel and Turkey with asking prices going up to 50,000 lira ($38,760).\n\nHakan, a 27-year-old security guard in Istanbul with two young children who also requested only his first name be published, told Reuters he received five or six offers from Turkey and Germany, offering 10,000-15,000 lira ($11,600), but he's holding out for 40,000 lira. \"Of course it's frightening but there's nothing else to be done,\" he said, adding he hadn't told his wife as he knew she would object. \"I'm doing it because of my family, if I was alone it wouldn't matter.\n\nI've got two children ... there's nothing else I can do for them.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nAll rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten,

    "text": "LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters) -- \"To insure or not to insure?\" It isn't Shakespeare, but it is the dramatic question Hollywood filmmakers are asking about Lindsay Lohan following her legal troubles this week.\n\nLindsay Lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled, but the cost will be high.\n\nIt is an important question, too, because whether companies insure Lohan's future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off Hollywood's A-list.\n\nBut Lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable, say underwriting experts.\n\nWhile some producers may balk at conditions for hiring problematic stars, experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison, even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost. \"For a price, anything can be done, although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just won't be interested,\" said Ross Miller, partner with insurance brokerage D.R.\n\nLohan's arrest this week in Los Angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left Hollywood wondering if the actress, who shot to fame as a child in Disney films like \"The Parent Trap,\" is too risky to cast in a film.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether her latest relapse and brush with the law will cost her a role in \"Poor Things,\" a film produced by and starring Oscar-winner Shirley MacLaine.\n\nA statement was expected early next week on whether the movie, already delayed this spring due to an earlier rehab stint by Lohan, will proceed with or without her.\n\nInsurance experts say the industry has long dealt with similar situations, although they may seem more frequent with the recent heavy media scrutiny of Lohan and fellow troubled party girls Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. \"I don't think it (a problematic artist) is any more of an issue,\" said Wendy Diaz, entertainment underwriting director at Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., the leading film underwriter. \"It's pretty standard year to year.\" But Diaz did say the terms for covering Lohan would likely be \"serious at this point.\" She said Fireman's Fund, in such a case, would likely put in higher deductibles, or ask the star to put their salary into escrow to pay for any losses if production was disrupted.\n\nLast July, a producer on Lohan's last film, \"Georgia Rule,\" scolded her publicly for repeatedly showing up late on the set, costing the movie's makers hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nBrian Kingman, a managing director with entertainment insurance broker Aon/Albert G.\n\nRuben said covering situations like Lohan's required a lot of calculation and risk management.\n\nInsurance rates for errant actors can range anywhere from 1 percent to 3 percent of a movie's production budget, which can range from $5 million to $100 million or more, he said. \"Filmmakers fall in love with certain actors for certain roles and my job is to find risk-takers to take on the risk,\" Kingman said.\n\nHe said actors were always required to undergo a medical exam before getting insurance.\n\nIn certain circumstances, drug screening is conducted and actors are required to provide blood and urine samples.\n\nIn cases of known drug abuse, \"minders\" are sometimes required on set to keep an eye on the actor.\n\nKingman said he had even helped craft policies for actors in the event they risked the possibility of incarceration. \"I have been successful in finding and creating incarceration coverage for certain actors on probation which can be revoked if they break certain rules,\" he said, citing the case of Robert Downey Jr., another high-profile star with a history of legal, drug and alcohol problems.\n\nAll rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.",

    "text": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Youssif, the 5-year-old burned Iraqi boy, rounded the corner at Universal Studios when suddenly the little boy hero met his favorite superhero.\n\nYoussif has always been a huge Spider-Man fan.\n\nMeeting him was \"my favorite thing,\" he said.\n\nSpider-Man was right smack dab in front of him, riding a four-wheeler amid a convoy of other superheroes.\n\nThe legendary climber of buildings and fighter of evil dismounted, walked over to Youssif and introduced himself.\n\nSpidey then gave the boy from a far-away land a gentle hug, embracing him in his iconic blue and red tights.\n\nHe showed Youssif a few tricks, like how to shoot a web from his wrist.\n\nOnly this time, no web was spun. \"All right Youssif!\" Spider-Man said after the boy mimicked his wrist movement.\n\nOther superheroes crowded around to get a closer look.\n\nEven the Green Goblin stopped his villainous ways to tell the boy hi.\n\nHe didn't take a liking to Spider-Man's nemesis.\n\nSpidey was just too cool. \"It was my favorite thing,\" the boy said later. \"I want to see him again.\" He then felt compelled to add: \"I know it's not the real Spider-Man.\" This was the day of dreams when the boy's nightmares were, at least temporarily, forgotten.\n\nHe met SpongeBob, Lassie and a 3-year-old orangutan named Archie.\n\nThe hairy, brownish-red primate took to the boy, grabbing his hand and holding it.\n\nEven when Youssif pulled away, Archie would inch his hand back toward the boy's and then snatch it.\n\nThe boy giggled inside a play area where sponge-like balls shot out of toy guns.\n\nIt was a far different artillery than what he was used to seeing in central Baghdad, as recently as a week ago.\n\nHe squealed with delight and raced around the room collecting as many balls as he could.\n\nHe rode a tram through the back stages at Universal Studios.\n\nFire and smoke filled the air, debris cascaded down and a big rig skidded toward the vehicle.\n\nThe boy and his family survived the pretend earthquake unscathed. \"Even I was scared,\" the dad said. \"Well, I wasn't,\" Youssif replied.\n\nThe father and mother grinned from ear to ear throughout the day.\n\nYoussif pushed his 14-month-old sister, Ayaa, in a stroller. \"Did you even need to ask us if we were interested in coming here?\" Youssif's father said in amazement. \"Other than my wedding day, this is the happiest day of my life,\" he said.\n\nJust a day earlier, the mother and father talked about their journey out of Iraq and to the United States.\n\nThey also discussed that day nine months ago when masked men grabbed their son outside the family home, doused him in gas and set him on fire.\n\nHis mother heard her boy screaming from inside.\n\nThe father sought help for his boy across Baghdad, but no one listened.\n\nHe remembers his son's two months of hospitalization.\n\nHe could hear his boy's piercing screams from the other side of the hospital.\n\nWatch Youssif meet his doctor and play with his little sister » .\n\nThe father knew that speaking to CNN would put his family's lives in jeopardy.\n\nThe possibility of being killed was better than seeing his son suffer, he said. \"Anything for Youssif,\" he said. \"We had to do it.\" They described a life of utter chaos in Baghdad.\n\nNeighbors had recently given birth to a baby girl.\n\nShortly afterward, the father was kidnapped and killed.\n\nThen, there was the time when some girls wore tanktops and jeans.\n\nThey were snatched off the street by gunmen.\n\nThe couple said they had heard reports that a young girl was kidnapped and beheaded --and her killers sewed a dog's head on the corpse and delivered it to her family's doorstep. \"These are just some of the stories,\" said Youssif's mother, Zainab.\n\nUnder Saddam Hussein, there was more security and stability, they said.\n\nThere was running water and electricity most of the time.\n\nBut still life was tough under the dictator, like the time when Zainab's uncle disappeared and was never heard from again after he read a \"religious book,\" she said.\n\nSitting in the parking lot of a Target in suburban Los Angeles, Youssif's father watched as husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, parents and their children, came and went.\n\nOthers smiled and laughed. \"Iraq finished,\" he said in what few English words he knows.\n\nHe elaborated in Arabic: His homeland won't be enjoying such freedoms anytime soon.\n\nBut this week, the family has seen a much different side of America -- an outpouring of generosity and a peaceful nation at home. \"It's been a dream,\" the father said.\n\nHe used to do a lot of volunteer work back in Baghdad. \"Maybe that's why I'm being helped now,\" the father said.\n\nAt Universal Studios, he looked out across the valley below.\n\nIt was a picturesque sight fit for a Hollywood movie. \"Good America, good America,\" he said in English.",

    "title": "Prince Harry describes Princess Diana as \"the best mother in the world\"",
    "text": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Prince Harry led tributes to Diana, Princess of Wales on the 10th anniversary of her death, describing her as \"the best mother in the world\" in a speech at a memorial service.\n\nWilliam and I can separate life into two parts.\n\nThere were those years when we were blessed with the physical presence beside us of both our mother and father.\n\nPrinces Harry and William greet guests at a thanksgiving service in memory of their mother.\n\nAnd then there are the 10 years since our mother's death.\n\nWhen she was alive, we completely took for granted her unrivaled love of life, laughter, fun and folly.\n\nShe never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated.\n\nShe will always be remembered for her amazing public work.\n\nBut behind the media glare, to us, just two loving children, she was quite simply the best mother in the world.\n\nShe laughed hysterically and uncontrollably when sharing something silly she might have said or done that day.\n\nShe encouraged us when we were nervous or unsure.\n\nShe -- like our father -- was determined to provide us with a stable and secure childhood.\n\nTo lose a parent so suddenly at such a young age, as others have experienced, is indescribably shocking and sad.\n\nIt was an event which changed our lives forever, as it must have done for everyone who lost someone that night.\n\nBut what is far more important to us now, and into the future, is that we remember our mother as she would have wished to be remembered as she was: fun-loving, generous, down-to-earth, entirely genuine.\n\nWe speak about her and laugh together at all the memories.\n\nPut simply, she made us, and so many other people, happy.\n\nMay this be the way that she is remembered.\n\nPrince William's reading from St Paul's letter to the Ephesians: .\n\nI bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name.\n\nI pray that, according to the riches of His glory, He may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through His Spirit, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and grounded in love.\n\nI pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.\n\nNow to Him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine, to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, for ever and ever.\n\nThe Bishop of London's speech: . \"Who's cheating?\" The scene is an old people's home.\n\nThe question from the royal visitor is unexpected but everyone laughs.\n\nAfterwards they comment on her large eyes and what life she brought into the room.\n\nOne tiny incident, characteristic of countless other occasions in the Princess's public life in which she found the right word or the right gesture to bring cheer and comfort.\n\nI remember meeting Princess Diana for the very first time early in 1981 to discuss details of the wedding service in St Paul's.\n\nEven Archbishop's Chaplains have their share of proper diffidence and I was nervous entering the presence.\n\nIt must have been a bewildering time for the Princess as well, but even then, at the age of 20, her capacity for empathy and her very strong intuitive power ensured that any tension soon evaporated.\n\nPrince Harry has spoken movingly and justly, as few others have the right to do, about the Princess as a mother.\n\nI want to dwell for a moment on her public work, its cost and its meaning.\n\nAfter her marriage, the Princess joined her natural gifts of beauty, empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the Royal Family generates.\n\nLed by our Queen and other members of the Royal Family, our constitution has developed in response to the challenges of the past century.\n\nThere is a properly political sphere in which the monarch may counsel but doesn't intrude, but there is another sphere, vital to any sense of national unity and creativity, a sphere in which communities must be celebrated, common values articulated and the transcendent source of those values honored.\n\nWe tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is God's will, but if no-one can articulate in an un-ignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in Christ, the human face of God, then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society.\n\nAnd at a time when people are suspicious of rhetoric, the monarchy communicates by symbol and by simple speech, and the Princess brought her own gifts to this work.\n\nShe was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the Middlesex Hospital's Aids ward.\n\nIt was the first in the UK and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded Aids in the '80s.\n\nThose familiar with the field have no doubt that the Princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin.\n\nAnd she had a similar impact in the USA.\n\nAn editorial in the New York Times in 1989 admitted ruefully that it had taken a foreign, and even a royal, dignitary to draw attention to a major public health concern in the US.\n\nHer work in the very last year of her life for the victims of landmines also caught the popular imagination internationally and certainly accelerated the adoption of the Ottawa Convention, banning the use of a weapon which disproportionately kills and maims women and children.\n\nShe proved the eloquence of embrace and of touch which, of course, have been used by royal healers throughout the centuries.\n\nAnd as she said, in her words, \"the biggest disease today is not leprosy or TB but the feeling of being unwanted\".\n\nShe sought out places of suffering, because they are so very often places of truth where the masks have been removed, and she was not afraid to be with the dying and to comfort them in an unsentimental way.\n\nBill Deedes accompanied her on some of her visits.\n\nHis response to the cynics was typically robust.\n\nHe said: \"She was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society and who did it so well.\n\nShe was good at this because she herself was vulnerable.\n\nShe didn't set out to be a saint.\" The role brought great power but, like any member of the Royal Family, she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny.\n\nHonoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over one's personal humanity is a desperately difficult task.\n\nAs we have heard from Prince Harry, his mother Diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead.\n\nShe confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched.\n\nShe said of John, a young Greek suffering from cystic fibrosis: \"He showed no sign of anger, no trace of bitterness but touched us all with an aura of optimism and hope for the future such that I have never before encountered.\" The love of Christ described in the lesson read by Prince William contains the essence of the spiritual life.\n\nPrincess Diana recognized this quality of life in many of those, like John, whose lives she touched.\n\nIt was a mystery which resonated deeply with her and for which she reached out.\n\nAnd the mystery is this - the more you go beyond yourself, the more you will become your true self; the more you lose yourself in loving and serving others, the more you will find yourself; the more you keep company with those who suffer, the more you will be healed.\n\nThis is the knowledge which passes all understanding.\n\nThis is certain and has been proved experimentally in the life of all the saints.\n\nIt's easy to lose the real person in the image, to insist that all is darkness or all is light.\n\nStill, 10 years after her tragic death, there are regular reports of \"fury\" at this or that incident, and the Princess's memory is used for scoring points.\n\nLet this service mark the point at which we let her rest in peace and dwell on her memory with thanksgiving and compassion.\n\nLet us also, echoing the words of Prince Harry, look to the future and pray, in the words of St Paul, for all those who serve our country as members of the Royal Family and most especially for the sons who were so precious to her: . \"I pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power with all the saints to grasp what is the breadth and length and depth and height of the love of Christ and to know this love which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of God.\" Amen.",

    "text": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner's declaration that France had to prepare for the possibility of war against Iran over its nuclear program was not conventional diplomatic behavior.\n\nBut then Kouchner was never expected to be a soft-soaper on the diplomatic scene.\n\nFrench foreign minister Bernard Kouchner has a reputation for challenging convention and authority.\n\nA surprise appointment from the Socialist ranks to Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative government, the founder of Medicins Sans Frontiers has always challenged convention and authority.\n\nThe former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali once called Kouchner 'an unguided missile' and the man himself has been known to declare: \"To change the law you sometimes have to break the law\".\n\nHe was in his youth one of the leaders of the students revolt in France in May 1968.\n\nKouchner is a humanitarian as well as a patriot, with a strong commitment to human rights.\n\nUnusually for a man of the Left, he supported the US-led intervention in Iraq (while criticizing the aftermath).\n\nBut he did so on the grounds of Saddam Hussein's denial of human rights, not his possible possession of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nHis and President Sarkozy's concern for human rights lies behind their eagerness to join Gordon Brown's Britain in a new push for action in Darfur.\n\nBernard Kouchner did not come to his position with any of former President Chirac's instinctive distrust of the United States.\n\nWashington, which has been critical of some European states for their weakness in confronting Teheran, will have been delighted by his 'get serious' warning to Teheran.\n\nBut the plain-speaking Kouchner is unlikely to be deterred by fears of upsetting the White House when he has criticisms to make of US policy.\n\nHow much should be made of his words on Iran remains unclear at this stage.\n\nThey were scarcely on the same scale as President Chirac's threat when he was still in office to retaliate with nuclear strikes against any state found to be responsible for a large-scale terrorist attack on France.\n\nBut they are all of a piece with France's new high-profile style under the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\nMr Kouchner, for example, became the first French Foreign Minister to visit Iraq since 1988, insisting that there could only be a political solution to the country's problems, not a military one, and offering France's services as a mediator and 'honest broker' between Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds.\n\nOn Iran he is, in a way, merely echoing the words of his President who declared in a speech last month that a nuclear-armed Iran would be 'unacceptable' and describing the stand-off over its nuclear program as 'undoubtedly the most serious crisis before us today'.\n\nCertainly Mr Kouchner is making clear that France no longer takes the view once expressed by President Chirac that a nuclear-armed Iran might be inevitable .\n\nIn continuing to ratchet up the rhetoric over that threat and to underline the West's resolution on Iran's nuclear enrichment program Mr Kouchner is supplementing his president's warnings.\n\nNeither is saying that military intervention against Iran is imminent or inevitable.\n\nNeither has yet confirmed that France would be part of any such military action.\n\nBut both are stressing the risks which are piling up as a result of Teheran's brinkmanship.\n\nPerhaps the strongest lesson though from Mr Kouchner's intervention is his underlining that the new administration in France is not a knee-jerk anti-American one -- and that France is in the business of reclaiming a role at the top diplomatic tables.",

    "title": "Several famous songs written by men for a woman .",
    "text": "1. \"Für Elise\" Bob Dylan wrote \"It Ain't Me, Babe\" for Joan Baez.\n\nWritten for: Some girl probably not named Elise.\n\nIn fact, as far as most historians can tell, Beethoven didn't even know an Elise.\n\nInstead, the song was originally titled \"Bagatelle in A minor\" based on some handwritten notation a Beethoven researcher claimed to have seen on a now-lost copy of the sheet music.\n\nFurther complicating things, Beethoven had hideous handwriting -- to the point that some scholars speculate the song was actually written \"for Therese,\" as in Therese Malfatti, one of several women who turned down a marriage proposal from the notoriously lovesick maestro. 2. \"Philadelphia Freedom\" Written by: Elton John & Bernie Taupin .\n\nWritten for: Billie Jean King, as a thank-you for a tracksuit she gave Elton.\n\nThe 1975 song remains one of the most popular disco hits ever, leaving thousands of Hustle enthusiasts wondering just what Billie Jean King had to do with Philadelphia, anyway.\n\nTurns out, the song was a reference to King's pro tennis team, The Philadelphia Freedoms.\n\nPrior to 1968, tennis players were all considered \"amateurs\" and weren't eligible to receive prize money.\n\nSo, if you didn't have the wealth to support yourself, you couldn't play.\n\nBillie Jean King fought against those constraints, ultimately founding Professional World Team Tennis in 1974 and turning tennis into a paid league sport. 3. \"Lola\" Written by: The Kinks' Ray Davies .\n\nAccording to Rolling Stone, \"Lola\" was inspired by Candy Darling, a member of Andy Warhol's entourage, whom Ray Davies briefly (and cluelessly) dated.\n\nIf that's the case, then \"Lola\" is just another notch on Darling's song belt -- she's also referred to in Lou Reed's \"Walk on the Wild Side.\" (\"Candy came from out on the Island/ In the backroom she was everybody's darlin'.\") But, in the Kinks' official biography, Davies tells a different story.\n\nHe says \"Lola\" was written after the band's manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five o'clock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him. 4. \"867-5309/Jenny\" Written by: Jim Keller (of Tommy Tutone) and Alex Call .\n\nWritten for: Unknown, as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they're asked.\n\nWhile the woman continues to remain a mystery, however, the phone number is all too real.\n\nIn fact, it's been wreaking havoc ever since 1982 and the passage of time hasn't quelled of the number of crank calls.\n\nIn 1999, Brown University freshman roommates Nina Clemente and Jahanaz Mirza found that out the hard way, when the school adopted an 867 exchange number for its on-campus phone system.\n\nImmediately, the girls' innocuous Room No. 5309 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish.\n\nOther unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions, like the holder of 212-867-5309, who put his phone number up for auction on eBay in 2004.\n\nBids approached $100,000 before eBay pulled the item at the request of Verizon, the number's actual owner. 5. \"Oh, Carol\" Written by: Neil Sedaka .\n\nSedaka and King actually dated briefly in high school -- a romance Sedaka was able to successfully milk with \"Oh, Carol,\" a then top-10 (if now somewhat forgettable) 1959 pop song.\n\nHowever, the real success of \"Oh, Carol\" came a few months later, when it inspired King to write a rebuttal entitled \"Oh, Neil.\" At the time, King and her husband, Gerry Goffin, were fledgling songwriters in need of a hit tune. \"Oh, Neil\" wasn't that, but it did pay off.\n\nAfter Sedaka gave a tape of the song to his boss, King and Goffin landed jobs at the legendary Brill Building pop music factory, where the duo went on to write chart-toppers like \"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\" and \"The Loco-Motion.\" 6. \"It Ain't Me, Babe\" Written by: Bob Dylan .\n\nWritten for: Joan Baez, though it clearly wasn't the nicest gift Dylan could have given her.\n\nThe two met in 1961, when Baez was an up-and-coming folk singer and Dylan was a nobody from Minnesota.\n\nDesperate to make his break in the music biz, Dylan worked like crazy to get Baez's attention.\n\nHe eventually ended up going on tour with her, which is how he first became famous, and also how the two began dating.\n\nFor a while, they seemed like the golden couple, but things soon went downhill.\n\nDuring a European concert tour together in early 1965, they had a huge fight and parted ways.\n\nThat May, Dylan was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus, and Baez, hoping to remain friends, decided to bring him flowers.\n\nSadly, that's how she found out that her ex was already dating someone else.\n\nThat someone else was Sara Lownds, whom Dylan married a mere six months later. 7. \"Our House\" Written by: Graham Nash (of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young) Written for: Joni Mitchell.\n\nIn December 1968, Nash and Mitchell moved into a cozy little house in the Laurel Canyon section of Los Angeles.\n\nThough commonly left out of the hippy pantheon, Laurel Canyon was sort of a commune-home away from commune-home for San Francisco society -- not just CSN&Y, but also Jim Morrison, the Eagles, Frank Zappa, and more. \"Our House\" was directly inspired by a lazy Sunday in the Nash/Mitchell household.\n\nThe couple went out to brunch, hit an antiques store, and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly, at which point Nash literally \"lit a fire,\" while Mitchell \"placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day.\" No, really.\n\nThe whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to Nash that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it.",

    "title": "Amount almost double what was spent in 2004 election cycle .",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A wide-open presidential race and a willingness by candidates, interest groups, unions and corporations to buy TV time will lead to historic spending for political and issue-advocacy advertising in the 2008 election cycle, an analysis shows.\n\nMitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential contenders.\n\nThe cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television advertising.\n\nThis is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $1.7 billion.\n\nIn 2006, $2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy TV commercials.\n\nJust about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer.\n\nThe costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters.\n\nSee how spending breaks down for this year » .\n\nAnd interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures.\n\nOn the national level, the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $270 million in the first nine months of this year.\n\nSubjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform.\n\nTelevision ads on health care alone total $60 million.\n\nCMAG estimates more than $3 million of the $270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008.\n\nTracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups \"pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode.\" \"What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries, and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates,\" he said.\n\nWith 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, CMAG predicts that more than $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House.\n\nUp to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nVoters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months.\n\nMitt Romney leads all candidates in TV spending, having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $8.6 million.\n\nThis is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle.\n\nWatch how Romney is way ahead in ad spending » .\n\nIn contrast, one of Romney's chief rivals for the GOP nomination, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has spent nothing on television ads, but Giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys.\n\nGiuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition, while Romney does not.\n\nIn the race for the Democratic nomination, Illinois Sen.\n\nBarack Obama has spent more than $2.3 million on television commercials, while New York Sen.\n\nHillary Clinton has spent $1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls.\n\nBill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest from the $2 million he has invested in his television commercials.\n\nRichardson's humorous TV ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker, diplomat and executive, and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate.\n\nRomney used his $8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to Republican voters.\n\nThese voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal Massachusetts.\n\nRomney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nFurther evidence of how Romney's television commercials have helped is in South Carolina.\n\nAn American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters.\n\nA month later, and with $350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll, Romney was up 17 percentage points.\n\nRomney's latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa, and in it he vows to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, to boost the military by 100,000 people, to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the U.S. from al Qaeda.\n\nAll of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nWhile only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the airwaves until now, Tracey said he expects this to change. \"Before the end of October, I suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air,\" Tracey said. \"As we get closer to primary day, the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last, best shot.\"

unforeseen events such as former Florida Rep.\n\nMark Foley's House page scandal or the September 11 terrorist attacks. \"Politics is completely beholden to events,\" he said. \"Events will ultimately determine how much is spent, where and when.\" What television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months? \"Chances are, just as what happened in 2006, voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads,\" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. \"The sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance.\n\nAfter a while, the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "text": "ABECHE, Chad (CNN) -- Most of the 103 children that a French charity attempted to take to France from Chad for adoption are neither Sudanese nor orphans, three international aid agencies reported on Thursday.\n\nHundreds of women protest child trafficking and shout anti-French slogans Wednesday in Abeche, Chad.\n\nSix members of Zoe's Ark were arrested last week as they tried to put the children on a plane to France, where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in.\n\nThree French journalists, a seven-member Spanish flight crew and one Belgian were also arrested.\n\nRepresentatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with Zoe's Ark and thought they were on a humanitarian mission.\n\nChadian President Idriss Deby hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be freed, his chief of staff, Mahamat Hissene, said Thursday.\n\nThe president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of Abeche, where the children were taken, to a judge in N'Djamena, the capital, Hissene said.\n\nThe transfer will take place Monday, according to media reports.\n\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees and UNICEF said most of the children were living with their families before Zoe's Ark took them.\n\nThe charity said the children were Sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a war-torn nation.\n\nThe agencies said most of the children also probably come from Chadian villages along Chad's border with Sudan.\n\nThe children have been living in an orphanage in Abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities.\n\nWatch a report on whether the children are orphans » .\n\nChadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identities.\n\nChad's interior minister said Zoe's Ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help.\n\nThe charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted.\n\nThe Spaniards and Belgian are charged with complicity.\n\nThe Spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released, a company executive said Thursday. \"We thought we were doing a humanitarian transport,\" said Antoni Cajal, sales director of Spain's Gir Jet charter firm. \"If an NGO [nongovernmental organization] has done something wrong, it's impossible for us to know.\" Spain's Foreign Ministry has publicly expressed its disagreement with the charges and has dispatched top diplomats to Chad to try to win the group's release.\n\nOver the weekend, the captain appealed urgently to be rescued, fearing the crew could be harmed or killed, Cajal said.\n\nBut the four women and three men are in good condition in custody, Cajal said, based on his conversations with a Spanish consular official who came from Cameroon to Chad and has been able to visit them.\n\nThe detention is the first problem of its kind for the company, which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue, Cajal said.\n\nOn its Web site, Zoe's Ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in Paris that sends teams of physicians, nurses, firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in France, who then apply for asylum on their behalf.\n\nThe Red Cross, UNHCR and UNICEF said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10, and they are healthy.\n\nThe agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds. \"So far, the interviews carried out with the children -- some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age -- led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from Chadian villages near the cities of Adre and Tine along the Chadian-Sudanese border,\" the agencies said. \"Ninety-one children said they had been living with their family, consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their parent,\" the agencies said, adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing.\n\nThe agencies called their investigation painstaking and challenging because of the number of children, their youth and the situation in the region.\n\nOther French charities earlier had questioned whether Zoe's Ark could legally arrange adoption of children from Darfur, and contacted French authorities, according to French newspapers and The Associated Press.\n\nFrench authorities have reacted angrily to the Zoe's Ark trip, calling the group's actions \"illegal and irresponsible.\" The French Foreign Ministry has said the dispute will not affect France's participation in a European peacekeeping force due to be deployed along the border between Chad and Sudan.\n\nIn response to the dispute in Chad, the Republic of Congo said late Wednesday it was suspending all international adoptions, The Associated Press reported.\n\nReporters Without Borders said it will work for the release of the three journalists arrested in Chad.\n\nThe organization said photographers Marc Garmirian of the Capa news agency and Jean-Daniel Guillou of the Synchro X agency were on assignment for their news organizations and were not part of the charity's efforts.\n\nThe third journalist, Marie-Agnes Peleran of the TV station France 3 Miditerranee, was traveling with the group in a personal capacity, though she carried a camera from her station,

    "text": "(CNN) -- Explorer Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland.\n\nFishermen pass by Greenland's Ilulissat fjord in this September 2004 picture.\n\nSuch a discovery would usually elicit curiosity, even wonder perhaps, but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer.\n\nThe island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to Greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier.\n\nBut such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island. \"I very quickly realized two things,\" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year. \"One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change.\" \"The other thing was that it meant it was really happening.\n\nIt was really happening.\" He calls his discovery Warming Island.\n\nMany climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming.\n\nMany global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the world's climate and geography.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels, flooding cities and altering seashores.\n\nOther scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet's life.\n\nMost of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere.\n\nBut why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious.\n\nThe Earth's temperature averages about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (about 16 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) during the last century, according to the National Research Council.\n\nThe temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910, according to the U.S.\n\nThey rose till about 1945, cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day.\n\nThere are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say.\n\nA change in the Earth's orbit or the intensity of the sun's radiation could change, triggering warming or cooling.\n\nThe reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet's temperature at a comfortable level.\n\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commonly referred to as the IPCC.\n\nThe presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades, according to the EPA.\n\nMeanwhile, nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years.\n\nMany scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests. \"For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it,\" Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said. \"A vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming,\" he added.\n\nMany scientific organizations share Schneider's view, ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the G8 to the National Research Council, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union.\n\nBut there are those who do not share his view, and among the skeptics is Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"We've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves,\" he said. \"When we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970, we were proclaiming global cooling.\n\nSince then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming.\" He believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability, where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal. \"The Earth is always getting colder and warmer,\" he said. \"It's always changing.\n\nIn fact, this is true of any fluid-covered planet.\" Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained. \"We don't know why, but it's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they've occurred,\" he said. \"What we're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that's occurring due to global warming.\" Yet, for Schneider, it is a cause for concern and alarm. \"We're already in serious melt, nobody can explain it.\n\nThe models don't predict it,\" he said. \"We don't know what's going on up there.\n\nAll we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty.\" The greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world's nations.\n\nThe IPCC in February 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels, temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4.5 degrees Celsius) by 2100.\n\nThe lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and flooding, Schneider said.\n\nThe higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of Hollywood filmmakers.\n\nUncertainties, however, plague such forecasts, which are based on computer simulations and models.\n\nThe models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere, oceans and continents interact, all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them. \"Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know,\" Schneider said. \"That it's going to warm up?\n\nI'd bet anything on that.\" E-mail to a friend .",

popular opposition leader under house arrest.\n\nPresident Pervez Musharraf explains his actions in a televised address Saturday.\n\nMusharraf also suspended the constitution and dismissed the Pakistan Supreme Court's chief justice for the second time.\n\nOn Sunday, police arrested the Javed Hashmi, the acting president of ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's opposition party was arrested, along with 10 aides, The Associated Press reported.\n\nHashimi was arrested when he stepped outside his house in the central city of Multan, AP reported.\n\nThe country is at a critical and dangerous

capital, Islamabad, Musharraf said his actions were \"for the good of Pakistan.\" Watch Musharraf's speech » .\n\nThere was quick condemnation from within and outside his country.\n\nThe Supreme Court declared the state of emergency illegal, claiming Musharraf -- who also is Pakistan's military chief -- had no power to suspend the constitution, Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry said.\n\nShortly afterward, government troops came to Chaudhry's office and told him the president had dismissed him from his job.\n\nJustice Abdul Hameed Dogar was quickly appointed to replace him,

Sunday, two dozen policemen raided the offices of AAJ-TV in Islamabad, saying they had orders to take the station's equipment.\n\nThe government also issued a directive warning the media that any

constitutional challenges to Musharraf's eligibility filed by the opposition.\n\nUnder the constitution, Musharraf couldn't run for another term while serving both as president and military leader.\n\nThe court allowed the election to go ahead, however, saying it would decide the issue later.\n\nSome speculated that the declaration of emergency is tied to rumors the court was planning to rule against Musharraf.\n\nMusharraf has said repeatedly he will step down as military leader before the next term begins on November 15 and has promised to hold parliamentary elections by January

    "text": "(Real Simple) -- Here are five great ways to enjoy your summer.\n\nLazing in a hammock is one of the best ways to spend a summer evening.\n\nBest way to cut jeans into shorts -- What better way to declare the start of summer?\n\nThe key to cutting off jeans is not to go too short too soon.\n\nSlip on the jeans and mark the desired length on one leg with chalk. \"Take them off, fold the leg at the mark, and iron the fold,\" says Caroline Calvin, creative director of Levi's. \"Then cut just under the crease with fabric scissors.\n\nLay the short jean leg on top of the other side and cut to evenly match.\" Repeat as needed to get the length you want.\n\nWith womanly wiles: \"Fireflies blink to attract a mate,\" explains naturalist Lynn Havsall, director of programs at the George B.\n\nDorr Museum of Natural History, in Bar Harbor, Maine. \"Males fly around while females sit in trees, in shrubs, or on the ground.\n\nSo find a female and watch her blinking pattern.\n\nThen imitate the pattern with a pen flashlight and the males will come to you.\" ]A plus: The bugs move slowly, so they're easy to trap in a jar.\n\nPunch some holes in the lid and add a little grass and a piece of fruit for moisture.\n\nAdmire your pretty night-lights till bedtime, then let them go.\n\nThe best way to run on the beach -- Who needs a treadmill when you have miles of shoreline?\n\nRunning on the beach can get you into great shape.\n\nTake it from lifeguard Benjamin Guss, 25, of Del Mar, California, who recently qualified to compete in this year's Iron Man triathlon (yes, that means swimming 2.4 miles, biking 112 miles, and then running a marathon -- consecutively) in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii.\n\nIf you choose to run barefoot, keep your workouts brief at first to allow tender soles to build up calluses. \"You can get blisters, even burns, from hot, soft sand,\" says Guss. \"I like to run barefoot, but for more than a couple miles, I wear shoes.\" Know your sand. \"In soft sand, one mile is like two,\" says Guss.\n\nYou may work foot and leg muscles you don't always use, so start slowly.\n\nAnd hard sand can be as tough on your legs as the road, so wear running sneakers.\n\nPick the right time to run. \"My favorite time is in the evening,\" says Guss. \"The wind dies down, and the sand isn't that hot.\" To work harder, fill small bags with sand to use as hand weights.\n\nThe best way to get in and out of a hammock -- Everyone looks good lazing in a hammock -- it's getting in and out that's tricky.\n\nTo make it less so, try these tips from Penny Waugh, a buyer for • Position your backside toward the hammock's center and tilt back until you reach a 45-degree angle, with the hammock parallel to your rear. • Gently sit back into the hammock and let it level out. • Swing your legs up and stretch them out. • Lie back.\n\nFor a graceful exit, sit upright and swing your legs off, anchoring your feet on the ground.\n\nThen push with your behind, gathering momentum to stand. \"It's tricky, since there's nothing to hold on to,\" says Waugh. \"But it's good for the glutes.\" The best way to tie espadrilles -- Apply this lace-up logic from Meghan Cleary, author of \"The Perfect Fit: What Your Shoes Say About You.\" • Slide your foot fully into the shoe and plant it firmly on the floor. • Cross and tie the laces once behind the ankle, then bring them forward, cross and tie again, and continue up the leg, depending on how long the laces are.\n\nThe calf is the maximum height -- any higher and you'll look like a gladiator. • Each time you cross and tie, secure the laces slightly tighter than is comfortable, since they will loosen a bit when you walk.\n\nJust don't cut off your circulation. • For a streamlined leg, make the final tie in the back.\n\nCreate a more whimsical look by putting the final tie in front with a small bow.\n\nGet a FREE TRIAL issue of Real Simple - CLICK HERE !",

    "title": "Jordan opens school doors to all Iraqi children, regardless of refugee status .",
    "text": "AMMAN, Jordan (CNN) -- In the sunbathed schoolyard of the Shmisani Institute for Girls in Amman, Jordan, principal Sanaa Abu Harb makes an announcement over the speaker system.\n\nIraqi students at the Shmisani school in Amman gather around a teacher.\n\nOne in 5 students there is Iraqi. \"All Iraqi girls come outside now.\n\nIraqi girls only!\" she repeats several times, making sure the message is clear and waving away Jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion.\n\nDozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground.\n\nHarb wants the CNN crew to see how many Iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating.\n\nThis school year, she says, 145 students are Iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 Iraqi children on a waiting list.\n\nWatch Iraqi girls describe a long way from home » .\n\nThe reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government policy: For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools.\n\nSimply, this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked.\n\nThe move is cementing a massive population shift in the Middle East.\n\nMore than 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland, most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials.\n\nJordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year.\n\nThat's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago.\n\nHarb, on the front line of the phenomenon, says the influx is putting a strain on her school.\n\nEven with some U.N. and U.S. aid to Jordan, there's still not enough money. \"We need more teachers here, more resources, more buildings, more chairs for all Iraqi students and our students,\" she says.\n\nIn a nearby neighborhood, in the study room of the Ahmed Toukan School for Boys, a handful of Iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home.\n\nSeated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth, the boys tell stories of horror and displacement.\n\nEighteen-year-old Qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to Jordan to try to live a normal life.\n\nMatter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare, he repeats the number: \"Five members.\" Most of the boys and young men from Iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation, but also their entry into the workforce.\n\nAll say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move, ready to live far from home and away from loved ones. \"It's not strange for me to be in the middle of people I don't know,\" says eleventh grader Ziad Tarek Al Shamsi. \"I had friends in Iraq when I was small, I left them.\n\nI came here, I left them.\" He pauses: \"But you have to miss your country.\" The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age Iraqi children are in Jordan.\n\nMany of them are enrolled in private institutions.\n\nBut as families run out of money they had when they left Iraq, they turn to public schools.\n\nEven so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year.\n\nAccording to the charity Save the Children, 21,000 Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian classrooms.\n\nAs a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families.\n\nThe lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees' fears of being identified through their children's school records.\n\nRegardless of what the final number will be this year, the population shift in the Middle East is, according to UNHCR head Antonio Guterres, the largest urban refugee situation in the world.\n\nIraqi families are changing the social fabric of Jordanian society.\n\nAbout 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them.\n\nThe schoolchildren are living examples of how the Iraq war may permanently change the Middle East. \"Iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education,\" says Touqan, the education minister. \"We will not run a parallel system of education.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "title": "President Bush nominated Mukasey to replace Alberto Gonzales .",
    "text": "(CNN) -- After weeks of controversy over Michael Mukasey's views on waterboarding, the Senate late Thursday approved the former judge's nomination for attorney general by a 53-40 vote.\n\nWaterboarding threatened to derail the approval of President Bush's nominee to lead the Justice Department.\n\nPresident Bush nominated Mukasey to replace longtime ally Alberto Gonzales, who resigned in September.\n\nThe nomination had been considered at risk after a number of Democratic senators opposed Mukasey because of questions that arose from his views on the terror interrogation technique known as waterboarding and the president's power to order electronic surveillance.\n\nMukasey, a former federal judge in New York, told senators he considers waterboarding \"repugnant,\" but he could not categorically say whether the technique amounts to torture, which U.S. and international law bans.\n\nWaterboarding is a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning.\n\nMukasey's confirmation was all but assured last week when two key Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee -- Sens.\n\nDianne Feinstein of California and Chuck Schumer of New York -- said they would vote in favor of Mukasey despite the controversy. \"The Department of Justice, once the crown jewel among government institutions, is adrift and rudderless,\" Schumer said Tuesday -- the same day the committee voted 11-8 to send Mukasey's nomination to the Senate floor. \"It desperately needs a strong and independent leader at the helm to set it back on course and I believe Judge Mukasey is that person.\" Schumer said that in a meeting Friday the nominee said that Congress would be within its rights to pass a law that bans waterboarding across all government agencies and that the president \"would have absolutely no legal authority to ignore\" it.\n\nSchumer said he believed Mukasey would be more likely to find waterboarding illegal than an interim attorney general. \"Indeed, his written answers to our notices have demonstrated more openness to ending the practices we abhor than either of this president's previous attorney general nominees have.\" But Mukasey's pledge to enforce such a law rang hollow with Sen.\n\nPatrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the Judiciary Committee's chairman. \"Some have sought to find comfort in Judge Mukasey's personal assurance that he would enforce a future, new law against waterboarding if this Congress were to pass one,\" Leahy said Tuesday. \"Unsaid, of course, is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this president.\" However, the committee's ranking Republican, Sen.\n\nArlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said he believed Mukasey would enforce a law banning waterboarding. \"He could have said a lot of things which would have given me more assurances,\" Specter said earlier. \"But he is intelligent; he's really learned in the law.\n\nHe's not an intimate of the president.\" A majority of Americans consider waterboarding a form of torture, but some of those say it's OK for the U.S. government to use the technique, according to a poll released Tuesday.\n\nAsked whether they think waterboarding is a form of torture, more than two-thirds of respondents, or 69 percent, said yes; 29 percent said no.\n\nAsked whether they think the U.S. government should be allowed to use the procedure to try to get information from suspected terrorists, 58 percent said no; 40 percent said yes.\n\nThe CNN/Opinion Research Corp. telephone poll of 1,024 American adults was carried out over the weekend and had a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.",

    "text": "(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of Congolese refugees fled camps Tuesday in the Democratic Republic of Congo as rebel troops attacked government forces in the area, the U.N. refugee agency said.\n\nRefugees move along a road Tuesday in Mugunga, near Goma, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees said it didn't appear rebels had targeted the camps, but it reported some were looted after camp residents, classified as internally displaced persons, fled.\n\nRoads to Goma, about 10 miles from the camps, were crowded with refugees and local residents fleeing the fighting, the UNHCR reported.\n\nTorrential rain made the movement even more difficult. \"The main road toward Sake was crowded with people; we had difficulties getting through,\" UNHCR field safety adviser Pierre Nazroo was quoted as saying in the agency's release. \"Internally displaced people are moving from site to site, direction Goma.\" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said, \"They have been living in extremely difficult conditions anyway.\n\nNow they have nothing but what they can carry.\" Redmond added, \"These are people in poor health; they are soaking wet because of the torrential downpours.\n\nThey need shelter, they need water, they need a lot of assistance so we're going to have to move quickly to get that help to them because a lot of them are already in a weakened state.\" While the Congolese government accused troops under rebel general Laurent Nkunda of staging the attack, a Nkunda spokesman denied the allegation, according to a report from the Integrated Regional Information Networks, a U.N.-affiliated news service.\n\nThe spokesman, Bwambale Kakolele, said Rwandan Hutu rebels who also operate in the area were behind the attack, that report said.\n\nA spokesman for the U.N. military mission in the Congo said it was uncertain which group attacked the Congo army outpost near the village of Kishangazi, according to the U.N.-affiliated news service. \"We think it could have been insurgents close to Nkunda who attacked, but we cannot rule out the [Rwandan rebels],\" spokesman Col.\n\nThe UNHCR identified the affected camps as Mugunga I, Mugunga II, Lac Vert and Bulengo, saying about 28,000 had abandoned the first three camps and about 2,000 had left Bulengo.\n\nThe UNHCR said 375,000 Congolese in North Kivu province have been forced from their homes in the past year.\n\nIn the past two months alone, 160,000 have fled their homes amid the fighting between renegade troops and government forces, the agency said.\n\nNorth Kivu is in eastern Congo near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda.\n\nCongolese President Joseph Kabila has tried to gain a cease-fire with the rebels in the area under Nkunda, but fighting continues as hard-liners among the rebels and in the government have blocked reconciliation efforts, according to the International Crisis Group, an nongovernmental organization looking for solutions to conflicts.",

    "title": "\"Wine Library TV\" Internet show has about 40,000 regular viewers .",
    "text": "(LiveWire) -- Voluble Gary Vaynerchuk, 31, the host of \"Wine Library TV,\" an online video show, has been known to lick rocks, suck leather and eat dirt while on camera, all to illustrate the unique properties of wine. \"Wine Library TV\" host Gary Vaynerchuk discusses four spooky wine varieties for Halloween show.\n\nOf a \"wild and gamey\" red from Rioja, Spain, Vaynerchuk says, \"Hit a deer on the road.\n\nThat's the flavor profile.\" That kind of attitude appeals to people who are mystified by the arcane lexicon of traditional wine journals or turned off by what they perceive as elitist barriers.\n\nAcross the Internet, budding wine geeks are discovering a burgeoning number of Web sites, blogs, bulletin boards and other outlets that preach the gospel of the grape in terms they can understand.\n\nAbout 40,000 Internet viewers -- many of them 20-somethings -- have a daily appointment with \"Wine Library TV.\" The low-budget video blog is produced five days a week from a nondescript office in the three-level wine retail operation that Vaynerchuk's family owns in Springfield, New Jersey.\n\nVaynerchuk has a discerning nose and palate, and he doesn't dumb down his subject.\n\nYet he stuffs his patter with sports and pop-culture references -- and the kind of language a Wine Spectator critic would be unlikely to employ.\n\nThe mission of wine sites like \"Wine Library TV,\" say several of the people behind these new outlets, is to demystify wine (and in some cases, sell it, too).\n\nUsing the language, attitude and new media that appeal to a young, tech-savvy generation, they advocate trusting one's own palate rather than obeying powerful wine critics.\n\nSome of the sites also provide opportunities for average wine drinkers to share their opinions.\n\nOne site, SavorEachGlass.com, declares its dedication to \"exploring the spirit of wine for a new generation,\" with reviews, online journals and essays that explain the finer points of winemaking -- all with attitude. \"The (wine) establishment is about ratings and 'reputation,'\" says the site's founder, Tynan Szvetecz, 29. \"It's about collecting the 'good' stuff as defined by someone else's palate and tastes.\n\nThat bores a younger generation.\" \"We're not afraid to be smartasses,\" he continues. \"We make fun of ourselves, old-world wine makers, new-world wine makers, and anyone else we can get our hands on.\" In the U.S., interest in wine is exploding.\n\nWhile consumption has leveled out in traditional wine-producing countries such as France, Italy and Spain, especially among young people, it has trended upwards in the U.S. for 15 straight years.\n\nThe U.S. is projected to overtake No. 2 Italy by the end of 2007, according to the annual report The U.S.\n\nWine Market: Impact Databank Review and Forecast a leading industry trade publication.\n\nMany of the new converts to wine are the so-called Millennials, the under-30 age group coveted by beverage marketers and so comfortable online that they're also called iGen, or the Internet Generation.\n\nOne of the wine Web sites targeting a younger demographic is VineSugar.com, which features a blog called \"Wine Burps.\" \"We love wine but hate the elitism,\" writes founder, Ryan O'Donnell. \"After all, it's just grape juice.\" With rants about wine tasting fees, a feature spotlighting \"wine hotties\" working at California wineries, as well as interactive maps that plot and rate wineries, VineSugar.com leaves little doubt about its target audience.\n\nCellarTracker.com, an online wine community, appeals to more established wine collectors.\n\nThe site provides free software -- designed by Eric LeVine, a fortuitously named former Microsoft software developer -- that allows wine enthusiasts to create an online inventory of their wines.\n\nThe 39,000 users (who count 6 million bottles in their virtual cellars) post reviews of their wines and access scores and other data via PDAs and cell phones.\n\nCommunity tasting notes shed light on how cellar-worthy wines are evolving, helping others decide when to crack open a treasured bottle.\n\nCorkd.com, another online community of wine fans, already had 40,000 users when Vaynerchuk purchased the site last year.\n\nThe free service allows users to catalog and review wines.\n\nInstead of having \"friends\" as on Facebook, members identify \"drinking buddies\" and check out what they're drinking.\n\nIn the growing presence of wine fans on the Internet -- newbies as well as connoisseurs -- Vaynerchuk sees a movement. \"They're part of forums, they meet up (offline),\" he says. \"It's about bringing people together.\n\nIt's all that's right about wine.\" Vaynerchuk should know.\n\nThe 300-plus shows he has taped in the past two years have developed a cult following of online fans, who call themselves \"Vayniacs,\" share wine tips and obsess about their hero on the site's forum.\n\nOn a recent rainy afternoon, Vaynerchuk barreled, unrehearsed and unscripted, through a 20-minute show in a single take.\n\nHe wrapped up Wine Library TV episode No. 337 with what has become his signature line. \"You, with a little bit of me, we're changing the wine world, aren't we?\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nLifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers.\n\nNeil Edward Schlecht is a

    "text": "PATUAKHALI, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Survivors of a storm that killed more than 3,000 people in the impoverished nation of Bangladesh grieved and buried their loved ones Monday as they waited for aid to arrive.\n\nVillagers grieve in Patargata, around 125 miles south of Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, Monday.\n\nThe number of dead killed from Cyclone Sidr -- now at 3,114 -- is expected to rise yet further as the South Asian nation continues to assess the damage.\n\nThe Bangladesh Red Crescent fears the death toll could be 5,000 -- perhaps even reaching as high as 10,000.\n\nIn the fishing village of Galachipa, in Patuakhali district, Dhalan Mridha was grieving for family members who died in the cyclone after ignoring an alert issued by authorities. \"Nothing is going to happen.\n\nThat was our first thought and we went to bed.\n\nJust before midnight the winds came like hundreds of demons.\n\nOur small hut was swept away like a piece of paper, and we all ran for shelter,\" Mridha, a 45-year-old farm worker, told The Associated Press.\n\nOn the way to a shelter, Mridha lost contact with his wife, mother and two children.\n\nThe Category 4 cyclone raked Bangladesh's southwest coast on Thursday with maximum sustained winds of 241 km/h (150 mph), destroying fishermen's hamlets and villages.\n\nThousands are still missing, while an estimated 280,000 others are unable to return to their homes which were wiped out by the storm.\n\nMany grieving families are now burying loved ones in single graves as no male members are available to dig them.\n\nMost houses in the region are made of flimsy materials such as bamboo and corrugated iron, and had no chance of withstanding the storm's powerful winds.\n\nIn addition, the storm-struck area is criss-crossed by a huge river delta which surged as Sidr pushed through, wiping out many villages and littering the river's shores with debris.\n\nWatch as people are left to fend for themselves » .\n\nLow-lying Bangladesh is already prone to flooding which has wiped out the country's rice production -- a major food staple for the impoverished country.\n\nImproved warning systems and shelters have kept the number of deaths far lower than the disastrous cyclones in the region of 1970 and 1991, when the tolls were in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nBangladesh President Iajuddin Ahmed visited the devastated region Sunday, handing out some aid to the crowds of people before members of the international media.\n\nIt was seen largely a token effort as hundreds were left empty-handed and furious.\n\nSecurity officials struggled to hold back the crowd.\n\nSee dramatic photos of storm survivors » .\n\nSidr has already ruined Bangladesh's rice harvest, but the international community is rallying to make sure the country does not suffer as acutely as it has in the past.\n\nNearly a million people died after massive floods wiped out the country's rice production in 1974.\n\nInternational aid organizations promised initial packages of $25 million during a meeting with Bangladesh agencies Monday, the U.N.'s World Food Program said.\n\nThe United States has offered more than $2 million as an initial contribution for emergency relief, and sent two U.S.\n\nAgency for International Development (USAID) is airlifting in relief supplies and an 18-person Department of Defense medical team is in Bangladesh helping the estimated 15,000 injured by the storm.\n\nBangladesh's government held an emergency Cabinet meeting Saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues, Bangladeshi government spokesman Fahim Munaim told CNN.\n\nOfficials fear the scope of the destruction may be much more extensive since there are remote areas where conditions cannot yet be determined.\n\nMunaim said nearly a third of Bangladesh's 64 districts were affected by the cyclone, most of those along the southern coast.\n\nThe Bangladeshi military is working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced.\n\nInternational aid groups -- including Save the Children, World Vision, and the Red Crescent, which already have offices in Bangladesh -- are deploying resources to the cyclone-stricken region but -- like the government -- they have found it nearly impossible to reach the more remote areas to assess conditions.\n\nRoads to remote areas are either blocked by massive trees fallen by the storm, or so severely damaged that it is impossible for vehicles to use.\n\nClearing could take weeks in the remote areas because it must be done by hand -- there are no chainsaws and modern machinery to speed up the process.\n\nAlong the broken road that leads into Kolapara, the body of an 8-year-old girl called Rummie was carefully carried away for burial.\n\nOverwhelmed with sadness, her mother Khadija was steadied by a relative. \"I am feeling too much pain in my heart,\" she said. \"I have lost my daughter, so I am a victim of the cyclone as well.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "text": "GLASGOW, Scotland -- World champions Italy clinched qualification for Euro 2008 after goals in the first and last minutes gave them a pulsating 2-1 victory at Hampden Park -- killing off Scotland's hopes of reaching the finals.\n\nLuca Toni celebrates his early goal as Italy won 2-1 in Scotland to clinch qualification from Group B.\n\nLuca Toni shot Italy in front but Scotland recovered to dominate and Barry Ferguson bundled home a 65th-minute leveller.\n\nHowever, Christian Panucci headed an injury-time winner after a controversial decision to award Italy a free-kick.\n\nThe result also means France have sealed qualification, along with Italy, from Group B without playing a game.\n\nIn a match played in torrential rain, Italy enjoyed the best possible start by taking the lead after just 70 seconds.\n\nGianluca Zambrotta spotted Antonio Di Natale unmarked in the box, and picked him out with a throw-in as Scotland were caught napping.\n\nDi Natale swept the ball into the path of Toni who delicately flicked into the top left corner from six meters out.\n\nThe home side almost conceded a second goal 60 seconds later.\n\nThis time, Toni turned provider and his cut-back was met by Mauro Camoranesi who fired over from close-range.\n\nToni then shrugged off two challenges before drawing a decent save from Craig Gordon with a well-struck effort that the goalkeeper did well to block at the near post.\n\nAt the other end, Scotland were denied the opportunity to haul themselves back into the match when a thunderous drive from Lee McCulloch appeared to be handled by Zambrotta inside the area but penalty claims were ignored.\n\nSpurred on by a sense of injustice, the hosts cranked up the pressure on their visitors.\n\nFerguson fired over from a James McFadden corner, before Alan Hutton nodded agonisingly wide of the upright following another perfect delivery from the Everton man.\n\nScotland then produced some wonderful passing football, which culminated in a tight-angled drive from Ferguson, but Gianluigi Buffon dived low to smother.\n\nThen came another scare for the home side.\n\nGordon was forced to pull a save out of the top drawer to deny a point-blank effort from Massimo Ambrosini, before Di Natale rifled the rebound into the back of the net.\n\nThe assistant referee raised his flag for offside but television replays suggested the official may have called it wrong.\n\nOnly last-gasp defending from the Italians prevented the Scots from grabbing a morale-boosting leveller on the stroke of half-time.\n\nDavid Weir rose above everyone else in a packed box to meet Ferguson's corner and his header appeared to be heading for the top corner before Andrea Pirlo somehow managed to nod off the line.\n\nA free-kick in a dangerous area provided Italy with the chance to start the second half as emphatically as they had started the first when Paul Hartley hauled down Camoranesi just outside the box.\n\nPirlo seized on the chance and looped the ball over the wall but, despite a reputation as a dead-ball specialist, his effort was easily dealt with by Gordon.\n\nInstead, it was Scotland who found the back of the net as Hampden erupted with 65 minutes gone.\n\nMcFadden's free-kick deflected into the path of McCulloch in front of goal.\n\nHe was denied by Buffon, but the rebound fell kindly to Ferguson and the captain gratefully rifled home from close-range.\n\nWith just over 15 minutes to go, Scott Brown was withdrawn for Kenny Miller as Scotland went for broke.\n\nThe Derby striker quickly began to cause the Italians problems and delivered a wonderful diagonal cross to the feet of McFadden but he fired wide when it looked easier score.\n\nScotland's impossible dream ended in the cruellest possible way when Italy snatched a last minute goal to secure their own qualification for Euro 2008.\n\nHutton appeared to be barged over in front of the corner flag but the referee inexplicably awarded the free-kick the other way and Panucci rose to meet Pirlo's cross and nod home the winner.\n\nItaly coach Roberto Donadoni said: \"We knew it was going to be a physical match given the atmosphere. \"But through their character and desire, the lads were fantastic.\n\nIt's something positive after all that happened last week (the death of the Lazio fan).\" Captain Fabio Cannavaro: \"This was a victory won with the heart.\n\nIt was difficult to play in this stadium, with that atmosphere it was like a cauldron. \"We played really well and managed to win.\n\nWe showed once again that we are a strong and compact team and when we need to win we do everything to show that we are the world champions. \"In Italy we play a high level of football, we've won the Champions League and the World Cup but unfortunately at this moment we are being noticed for something else.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "text": "(CNN) -- Authorities in Azerbaijan recently uncovered a radical Islamic terror plot against the U.S.\n\nEmbassy in the capital, Baku, prompting the facility to close its doors to the public Monday, Azerbaijan and U.S. officials told CNN.\n\nThe Bibi Heybat Mosque, just outside the capital Baku.\n\nAs a precaution, Britain also shut its embassy in Baku to the public on Monday \"following security concerns nearby,\" Britain's Foreign Office said.\n\nThe terror plot was unraveled after a weekend raid outside Baku that netted several suspected members of the radical group, two U.S. officials who asked not to be identified and a spokesman for Azerbaijan's National Security Ministry told CNN.\n\nState Department spokesman Sean McCormack stressed that the details \"are still unfolding,\" and the threat \"may or may not be\" linked to the Saturday raid. \"There were some specific and credible threat information concerning the embassy and plans by militants to in some way do harm to individuals in and around the U.S.\n\nEmbassy there,\" McCormack said, noting that no specific individuals were targeted.\n\nSeveral days ago, an Azerbaijani army officer who had connections to a radical Islamic group seized four assault rifles, a machine gun and 20 hand grenades from his military unit and hid them in the outskirts of Baku, the ministry spokesman and U.S. officials said.\n\nGovernment security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on Saturday in the village of Mastaga, about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Baku, the spokesman said.\n\nOne suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep, the spokesman said.\n\nSeveral others are still at large, he added.\n\nHe said the terror plot also targeted Azerbaijani government buildings.\n\nEmbassy in Baku issued a warden message warning Americans in Azerbaijan to take precautions. \"While there is no information at this time that other American or Western interests in Azerbaijan are being targeted, the U.S.\n\nEmbassy encourages Americans to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their own personal security,\" it said.\n\nAzerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea, and lies just north of Iran.\n\nMcCormack said U.S. authorities are working closely with their counterparts in Baku and will determine when normal embassy operations will resume.\n\nHe said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on Tuesday, as well.\n\nCNN's Igor Malakhov in Moscow, Zain Verjee in Washington and Roger Clark in London contributed to this report .",

    "text": "PARIS, France -- World number three Novak Djokovic crashed out of the Paris Masters after being trounced in his opening match by veteran Frenchman Fabrice Santoro on Wednesday.\n\nFabrice Santoro returns the ball during his shock second-round victory against Novak Djokovic.\n\nThe 34-year-old Santoro, who beat world No. 5 Andy Roddick at the Lyon Grand Prix last week, again rose to the occasion in front of his home fans as he stormed to a 6-3 6-2 second-round victory against the Serb.\n\nIt was the first time the two players had met, with Djokovic making his first outing since losing to David Nalbandian in the semifinals of the Madrid Masters two weeks ago.\n\nDjokovic, like the American Roddick, has already qualified for the season-ending Masters Cup and will now have extra time to prepare for the event in Shanghai starting next month.\n\nThe 20-year-old said he was struggling following dental surgery to remove two wisdom teeth. \"I couldn't give my 100 percent, not even 30 percent of my possibilities,\" Djokobvic said. \"He deserved to win.\n\nI didn't practise for a whole week, I only started practising two days ago.\n\nPhysically, I'm not feeling at all good.\" The result is a boost for rising British star Andy Murray, who earlier kept alive his hopes of an unexpected place at the Masters Cup by winning his first match in Paris and was expected to face Djokovic.\n\nThe 20-year-old, who has missed three months this season due to a wrist injury, beat Jarkko Nieminen of Finland 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 to progress into the third round.\n\nThe 15th seed is seeking to overtake Tommy Haas, who holds the eighth and final place ahead of the showpiece event in Shanghai.\n\nMurray, who trails the German by just three points, has not beaten Djokovic in three meetings so far but he has never played his unseeded next opponent Santoro.\n\nNinth seed Haas, who has struggled with illness and injury this year, will play Djokovic's compatriot Janko Tipsarevic in the second round.\n\nMurray, who won his second title this year at the St Petersburg Open last Sunday, made a confident start against Nieminen and showed little sign of the stiff back he suffered after a minor car crash on Monday.\n\nHe held his serve to love against a player who was beaten in the final of the Swiss Indoors event by Roger Federer last weekend, but then struggled for his best form as the first set went to a tiebreak.\n\nThe Scot was broken just one point after having a winner overturned following an on-court appeal, but he leveled immediately and then broke Nieminen again to win a third successive game before serving out for victory.\n\nDefending champin and fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko, one of six players to have already qualified for Shanghai, beat Argentina's Juan Del Potro 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 in his opening match on Wednesday.\n\nThe Russian, fined for \"lack of effort\" after his defeat by Croatian qualifier Marian Cilic in St Petersburg, will next face Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus in round three after Baghdatis shocked 13th seed Ivan Ljubicic.\n\nIvo Karlovic broke Roger Federer's serve for the first time in his life, but the top seed and world number one progressed in a late match on Wednesday.\n\nCroatian Karlovic, the tallest man in tennis at 2.08 metres, went down 6-4 4-6 6-3 as Federer played for the first time at the Bercy event since 2003.\n\nFederer had gone 67 service games over four previous matches without a loss before Karlovic ended his duck to claim their second set.\n\nBut the Swiss top seed got straight back in harness, breaking to start the final set and rolling ahead against a man he had just beaten days earlier in the Basel semifinals.\n\nWorld numbet two Rafael Nadal also reached the third round after thrashing Italy's Filippo Volandri 6-3 6-1.\n\nThe Spaniard will next play Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, who won by the same scoreline against 16th seed Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina.",

[Into the tape recorder:] Send me a box of makeup, Stila!\n\nWhen that happens, I feel like I have to clean out and give stuff to my sister, mom and friends because there comes a point of gluttony that I can't accept.\n\nIS: How do you think you express your personality through style?\n\nLast night at work they put my hair in two French braids to keep it flat under the scrub cap.\n\nI thought it looked cute and that I could pull it off after I'd slept on it.\n\nSo I thought I could recreate it myself ... no again.\n\nAs far as clothing style goes, I fluctuate almost as much as I do with beauty products.\n\nI like to shop for sweaters -- maybe it's the New Englander in me.\n\nI'm building a house in the mountains in Utah, so I tell myself I'm \"preparing\" for that.\n\nI like sweaters -- they're like scrubs -- you don't have to suck it in or worry about the bloat.\n\nIS: Do you know how you want your hair and makeup at your wedding?\n\nKH: I have an idea, but it's so dependent on the dress, and I haven't gotten there yet.\n\nMy sister is getting married too, so we looked for dresses together.\n\nAfter about five stores I was like, \"I'm done.\" Everyone says, \"You just know when you put that dress on.\" My sister found the right dress just like that.\n\nIS: Wait, so your mom has two daughters getting married within months?\n\nKH: My poor mother is probably like, \"Why, God?\n\nI want the day to be spectacular, but mostly I want it to be fun.\n\nAnd I don't want to freak out or stress.\n\nIS: Does your fiancé have any particular opinions about your look?\n\nKH: Josh wouldn't mind if my hair was brown, if it was still long -- that's such a boy thing.\n\nKH: I'd contemplate it, but I don't know if I actually have the courage to pull it off.\n\nI once wore a long hair-extension ponytail, and someone asked me if it was real, like I was one of those dolls when we were little, and the hair just cranks out.\n\nKH: My skin is sensitive, so everything bothers it.\n\nAnd I'm the jerk who keeps switching products and making it worse.\n\nKH: I got a great product at Ona Spa called Sebuspot.\n\nI've tried so many that were disappointments, but maybe I stand too close to the mirror examining my pores.\n\nIS: What do you always carry in your bag?\n\nAnd lip balm, either the Smith's Rosebud Salve or C.O.\n\nBigelow's Mentha Lip Shine in Black Cherry Soda from Bath & Body Works.\n\nIt's shiny with a little shimmer and tastes so good.\n\nIS: An In Style.com reader wants to know how you maintain a healthy body image in Hollywood.\n\nI love him with my whole soul and follow his 5-Factor diet.\n\nI first said, \"I'm never going to be -- nor do I want to be -- an uber-athletic girl.\" It's just not me and I don't have that kind of discipline.\n\nHe said, \"I just want you to be healthy.\" A lot of what we focus on is posture.\n\nI slump into myself when I get stressed.\n\nIf I were going to play an action hero, I'd have to get that look.\n\nFor me it's never about achieving a look that's impossible.\n\nGet a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE!",

    "text": "SPAM marks its 70th anniversary in 2007 which is also the Chinese Year of the Pig.\n\nIf the on-site \"wall of SPAM\" is any indication, a tour through the SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, is guaranteed fun for the whole canned-pork-loving family.\n\nSPAM's parent company, Hormel Foods, opened the establishment in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of SPAM.\n\nOne of the main attractions is a scale model of a SPAM plant, where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce America's favorite tinned meat. 2.\n\nIt's pretty hard to argue with the motto \"Any Day Above Ground is a Good One.\" So goes the backhanded optimism of the National Museum of Funeral History, a Houston facility that opened in 1992.\n\nVisitors are treated to exhibits that include a Civil War embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory.\n\nIn addition, the museum boasts an exhibit of \"fantasy coffins\" designed by Ghanaian artist Kane Quaye.\n\nThese moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken, a Mercedes-Benz, a shallot, and an outboard motor.\n\nAccording to Quaye, his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients, which -- let's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot. 3.\n\nIf you're bumming around but looking for a good time, be sure to take a load off in Britt, Iowa, at The Hobo Museum, which details the history and culture of tramps.\n\nBear in mind, though, that the museum kind of, well, slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual Hobo Convention.\n\nLuckily, tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year.\n\nOf course, if you're interested in the Hobo Convention, lodging is available all over the area, but it's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the \"hobo jungle,\" located by the railroad tracks.\n\nBoth the event and the museum are operated by the Hobo Foundation, which --incidentally -- also oversees the nearby Hobo Cemetery, where those who have \"caught the westbound\" are laid to rest. 4.\n\nOriginally, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia erected the Mütter Museum as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena. (You know, babies with two heads, that sort of thing.) But today, it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque.\n\nThere, you'll find the world's largest colon, removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation.\n\nAlso on display: an OB-GYN instrument collection, thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens, and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects. 5.\n\nWhat better way to honor \"Greatest Show on Earth\" founder P.T.\n\nBarnum than with a mediocre museum in Bridgeport, Connecticut?\n\nSome visitors will appreciate the museum's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus.\n\nBut only circus freaks (and by that we mean \"enthusiasts\") will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of Barnum's 40-inch-tall sidekick, General Tom Thumb. 6.\n\nThere's more than one theory about the assassination of John F.\n\nKennedy, so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well?\n\nMost JFK buffs are familiar with the Sixth Floor Museum housed in the former Texas School Book Depository, which recounts all those boring \"mainstream\" details of the late president's life leading up to his death at the hands of Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nBut just down the street, the Conspiracy Museum offers fodder for those less apt to buy into The Man's propaganda.\n\nFor the most part, the museum specializes in showings of the Zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories, including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement. 7.\n\nTake two trips to the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices and call us when you've lost all faith in the medical profession.\n\nThanks to curator Bob McCoy (who recently donated the collection to the Science Museum of Minnesota), those in search of history's quack science can find what they're looking for in the St.\n\nPaul tourist attraction, whether it's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers.\n\nIf you make the trip, be sure to check out the 1930s McGregor Rejuvenator.\n\nThis clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies, sans head, in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process. 8.\n\nWhat began as a training facility for Cook's Pest Control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest.\n\nAt Cook's Natural Science Museum in Decatur, Alabama, visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats, cockroaches, mice, spiders, and termites ... all for free.\n\nAnd while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them, museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing Pest of the Month keep reeling in patrons. 9.\n\nSo, what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville?\n\nThe Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum, of course -- where dummies go to die.\n\nThe Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, museum was the brainchild of the late William Shakespeare Berger, who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets.\n\nIn fact, he collected figures from some of the country's most famous ventriloquist acts.\n\nAnd with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling, you're bound to feel like you're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one.\n\nBut sadly, when Berger gave the tour, you could totally tell his mouth was moving. 10.\n\nMom wasn't kidding when she said one man's trash is another man's treasure.\n\nAt the Trash Museum in Hartford, Connecticut, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority (CRRA) turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment!\n\nT . our the Temple of Trash or visit the old-fashioned town dump.\n\nAnd for your recycler-in-training, head across the state to the Children's Garbage Museum, where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile, get a glimpse of the 1-ton Trash-o-saurus, or enjoy the company of resident compost worms.\n\nEntire contents of this article copyright, Mental Floss LLC.",

(Source: Interpol) The man's face was disguised by digital alteration, but the images were capable of being restored, according to a bulletin from Interpol -- the international police agency based in Lyon, France.\n\nNoble said the pictures have been on the the Internet for several years, but investigators have been unable to determine the man's identity or nationality. \"We have tried all other means to identify and to bring him to justice, but we are now convinced that without the public's help this sexual predator could continue to rape and sexually abuse young children whose ages appear to range from six to early teens,\" Noble said.\n\nHe said there is \"very good reason to believe that he travels the world in order to sexually abuse and exploit vulnerable children.\" Interpol has determined the photos were taken in Vietnam and Cambodia. \"The decision to make public this man's picture was not one which was taken lightly,\" said Kristin Kvigne, assistant director of Interpol's Trafficking in Human Beings Unit.\n\nThe suspect's photo and more information can be seen online at Interpol's Web site.",

    "text": "(Mental Floss) -- They say a lot of artistic expression is motivated by self-loathing.\n\nLong before the Material Girl ordered papa to stop preaching, these six puffed-up virtuosos knew darn well how to strike a pose.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock didn't leave people in suspense about how he felt about actors.\n\nHere's to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form.\n\nHitchcock was, without question, one of the towering geniuses of cinema.\n\nAnd, like many greats, he wasn't exactly the best collaborator.\n\nHitchcock was particularly trying for screenwriters, who felt he never properly credited them for their work.\n\nHe was once quoted as saying, \"Actors are cattle\" -- a quip that stirred up a huge outcry (actors can be so touchy).\n\nIn response, he issued this correction: \"I have been misquoted.\n\nWhat I really said is, 'Actors should be treated as cattle.'\" Although it began accidentally (when he was short an actor for the film \"The Lodger\"), Hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films, amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career.\n\nThe egotist's egotist, author Ayn Rand (born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum) is the patron saint of Thinking You're Better Than Everybody Else.\n\nHer most famous novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, are massive dramatizations of Objectivism, her self-spun Oscar-the-Grouch philosophy for success.\n\nObjectivism champions ego and accomplishment, shuns all religion as folly, and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society.\n\nRand's novels often focus on protagonists (invariably men) who are shunned by others because of their genius, but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant.\n\nNot surprisingly, she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as \"spitting in your own face.\" So, just how much did Rand believe in her own philosophy?\n\nWith signature modesty, she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas.\n\nWhen you create a cinematic masterpiece such as \"Citizen Kane\" at the ripe old age of 25, you're bound to get a big head.\n\nBut Welles was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that.\n\nIn fact, \"Citizen Kane\" might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego.\n\nAfter all, it's said he devised the film as a withering exposé of newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst because Hearst slighted Welles at a dinner party.\n\nOf course, after the unparalleled success of \"Citizen Kane,\" Welles's arrogant side didn't get any less subtle.\n\nDo yourself a favor: Track down a recording of Welles' outtakes for a TV commercial for frozen peas.\n\nYou'll hear everything you need to know about the filmmaker's oversized ego.\n\nA classic quote goes: \"In the depths of your ignorance, what is it you want?\" Frank Lloyd Wright .\n\nAs the brains behind the Robie House, Fallingwater, Taliesin West, the Guggenheim, and countless other design benchmarks, Frank Lloyd Wright is arguably the genius of 20th-century architecture.\n\nWright was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals.\n\nIn fact, the architectural egomaniac frequently acted as though the rules -- even those of geography and climate -- did not apply to him.\n\nIn 1935, department store magnate Stanley Marcus (of Neiman-Marcus fame) commissioned the architect to design his Dallas home, but the project quickly went sour.\n\nWright's avant-garde floor plan included \"sleeping porches\" that required his client to sleep outdoors year-round.\n\nIn addition, Marcus' small bedroom \"cubicles\" came equipped with almost no closet space.\n\nWhen Stanley respectfully explained that (a) temperatures during summer nights in Dallas often exceed 80 degrees and (b) a high-fashion tastemaker might need bigger closets, Wright threw a series of tantrums.\n\nFortunately for the voyeur in us all, said tantrums usually took place in letter form.\n\nPreserved and occasionally displayed at the Dallas Museum of Art, they make for delicious reading.\n\nSalvador Dalí . \"Every morning when I awake, the greatest of joys is mine: that of being Salvador Dalí.\" Yup, he actually said that.\n\nEverything about the legendary Surrealist painter (he of the melting clocks) -- from his whacked-out paintings to his curled-up mustache -- was designed to shock, destroy convention, cause scandal, and stir controversy.\n\nCriticized for choosing to live under General Franco's fascist government in Spain, Dalí defended his position by stating that he didn't care about others so long as he could be king.\n\nIf he wasn't getting enough attention, he was known to walk the streets of New York City clanging a hand bell.\n\nOf course, this is also the guy who once said, \"The thought of not being recognized [is] unbearable.\" Need another telling quote? \"At the age of 6 years, I wanted to be a chef.\n\nAt the age of 7, I wanted to be Napoleon.\n\nMy ambitions have continued to grow at the same rate ever since.\" Apparently, so did his ego.\n\nPlenty of performers this side of Gallagher have been labeled \"the world's greatest entertainer.\" But Al Jolson really, really believed it.\n\nThe vaudeville singer, actor, dancer, and comedian was born Asa Yoelson in Seredzius, Lithuania, in what was then part of Imperial Russia.\n\nAs a performer, he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows, ad-libbing, or just stopping to talk to the audience.\n\nDuring a 1911 performance of the critically hated \"Paris is a Paradise for Coons\" (title not edited for political correctness), Jolson stopped and asked the audience if they'd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play.\n\nThe crowd roared with applause, and Jolson ditched the whole program and took over.\n\nFrom that moment on, no one else could share the stage with him.\n\nUnlike some of the egomaniacs on this list, however, Jolson can be forgiven somewhat for his arrogance.\n\nAccording to most contemporary accounts, he actually was the greatest in the world.\n\nBut, despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen, Jolson's legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface (considered highly offensive now, but pretty common at the time).\n\nEntire contents of this article copyright, Mental Floss LLC.",

    "text": "(CNN) -- The owner of a North Carolina beach house where seven college students died in a weekend fire said Monday that his family's \"lives were just changed forever\" by the tragedy.\n\nChip Auman said his 18-year-old daughter survived the fire but was hospitalized and in stable condition because of complications from smoke inhalation. \"The thought of losing a child is unimaginable to me, and as a father my heart goes out to the families that lost a loved one in this situation,\" he said.\n\nAuman said the situation was \"hard to fathom.\" \"There's just no words to describe what we've been going through,\" he said, asking for prayers for survivors and the families of those who died. \"We're numb, we're confused, we're heartbroken.\" Two college campuses mourned Monday.\n\nSix University of South Carolina students and a Clemson University student died in the fire early Sunday morning in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina.\n\nSix other South Carolina students were able to get out of the house in time.\n\nThe six were treated and released from nearby Brunswick Community Hospital, but Auman's daughter was hospitalized again in Hartsville, South Carolina.\n\nAuthorities from the state Bureau of Investigation and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are leading the investigation into the cause of the fire.\n\nOcean Isle Beach Mayor Debbie Smith said the house was \"engulfed\" in flames when the fire department arrived on the scene, about five minutes after being notified.\n\nThe flames shot into the sky and ultimately left little more than portions of the framing.\n\nFire officials do not believe foul play was involved.\n\nWatch a neighbor's video, fears of fast-burning fire » .\n\nPruitt, the vice president for student affairs for the University of South Carolina, said investigators have said it would be Tuesday or Wednesday before the identities of the victims are confirmed publicly.\n\nIt could be as much as a month until investigators know the cause of the fire, Pruitt said.\n\nThe university did not cancel classes on Monday, but Pruitt said arrangements had been made for those who need to go home or stay out of class at the 28,000-student campus.\n\nPruitt said meetings had been held Sunday with members of Delta Delta Delta sorority and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.\n\nThe South Carolina students were affiliated with those houses, he said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Greek function.\n\nHe also said counselors and ministers were available to help students deal with the loss of their classmates.\n\nAndrew Sorenson, contacted the families of those who died in the fire to express the condolences and support of the university community.\n\nJay Laura, student president of the USC chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said the campus would pull together after the tragedy. \"If any place can come together to help in the healing process and the aftermath of an event like this, it is South Carolina,\" Laura said at a Monday afternoon press conference.\n\nFire survivor Tripp Wylie, a 20-year-old South Carolina sophomore, said he jumped out of a third-story window into a canal to escape the flames and was unable to get back in to help his friends. \"I could see a buddy of mine off to the left who had gotten out.\n\nHe was just yelling at me to jump and stuff,\" Wylie told CNN affiliate WYFF. \"The smoke was pouring out, couldn't really breathe, so I had to make a quick decision. [I] just kind of leaned out the window and luckily I jumped far enough to make it into the canal.\" Neighbors flocked to see the fire as firefighters battled and ultimately got the blaze under control.\n\nGeorge Smith, who lives across the street from the house, said he heard sirens between 6:30 and 7 a.m. and went outside to see \"the whole sky lit up.\" \"The whole house was completely engulfed in flames, up to about 20 feet,\" he said. \"I have never seen [a fire] move so fast.\" George Smith said the house's occupants were \"partying in there yesterday and into the night.\" After about 10:30 p.m.\n\nLinda Sing said she was walking her dog when she saw the fiery destruction.\n\nShe noted that firefighters had saved an adjacent house by spraying it down with water. \"We knew there were people in there, but we hoped and prayed they'd gotten out,\" Sing said. \"This is the worst thing I've ever seen.\n\nWe've had hurricanes, but this is worse.\" Ocean Isle Beach is a popular resort destination along North Carolina's southern coast.\n\nThe year-round population of the 7-mile-long island is about 425, but it swells to about 25,000 during the summer season, according to the town's Web site.",

    "text": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The head of Britain's intelligence services has warned that children as young as 15 are becoming involved in terrorist-related activity.\n\nJonathan Evans, the chief of MI5, also said that at least 2,000 people in Britain pose a threat to the country's security because of their support for al Qaeda-inspired terrorism. \"As I speak, terrorists are methodically and intentionally targeting young people and children in this country.\n\nThey are radicalising, indoctrinating and grooming young, vulnerable people to carry out acts of terrorism,\" he told a gathering of newspaper editors in Manchester.\n\nEvans said the figure of 2,000 -- an increase of 400 since November 2006 -- only included those the intelligence services knew about and that the actual number could be double.\n\nHe said there had been 200 terrorist convictions in Britain since the September 11 attacks.\n\nThe MI5 head added that over recent years much of the command and inspiration for attack planning in the UK had come from al Qaeda's remaining core leadership in the tribal areas of Pakistan.\n\nHowever, he said in the last 12 months terrorist plots on British soil were increasingly inspired by al Qaeda cadres in other countries, including in Iraq and East Africa. \"There is no doubt now that al Qaeda in Iraq aspires to promote terrorist attacks outside Iraq.\n\nThere is no doubt that there is training activity and terrorist planning in East Africa -- particularly in Somalia -- which is focused on the UK,\" he told the Society of Editors meeting.\n\nAccording to Evans, there had been \"no decrease\" in the number of Russian covert intelligence officers operating in Britain since the end of the Cold War.\n\nHe said that resources that could be devoted to counter-terrorism were instead being used to protect Britain against spying by Russia, China and others. \"A number of countries continue to devote considerable time and energy trying to steal our sensitive technology on civilian and military projects and trying to obtain political and economic intelligence at our expense,\" he said.",

    "text": "SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- You must know what's really driving the immigration debate.\n\nRuben Navarrette Jr.: Some opponents of immigration, even the legal kind, fear changes in local culture.\n\nImmigration restrictionists -- and by that, I mean those who want to limit all immigration, even the legal kind -- like to pretend they're so high-minded.\n\nThey always take the low road and harken back to the nativism that greeted earlier waves of immigrants.\n\nThe restrictionists insist that what bothers them are merely practical concerns: that our borders aren't secure, that so many immigrants are coming into the country illegally, and that the new arrivals are burdening schools and draining social services once they get here.\n\nIf that's the extent of it, then why does the conversation quickly turn to the impact -- both real and perceived -- that immigrants have on American culture through everything from taco trucks to Spanish-language billboards.\n\nThat seems to be the issue in North Dakota, where, according to a recent article in USA Today, towns facing tough economic times are nonetheless resisting a cultural transfusion that could save them.\n\nIn Cooperstown, the locals opposed efforts to bring in a hog plant and a dairy, because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract ... guess who?\n\nThe article quotes Orville Tranby, a local community leader in Cooperstown, who says that some residents have told him \"face to face\" that such facilities might attract Hispanic immigrants who could change the local culture.\n\nYou'll find the same fear in Lewisburg, Tennessee.\n\nNot long ago, an employee at a local library came up with the radical idea of a bilingual story time where children could hear tales read to them in Spanish.\n\nThey demanded that all books purchased by the library, or even donated, be in English-only.\n\nThese stories are ridiculous, but they're also helpful.\n\nThey illustrate what some people are really concerned about with immigration, and it goes well beyond words like \"legal\" or \"illegal.\" It's the perception that the country is becoming more Hispanic, that Spanish is replacing English, that Hispanic immigrants are weakening American identity, and that Main Street is turning into Little Mexico.\n\nA leader of the vigilante Minuteman movement moronically called it the \"colonization\" of the United States.\n\nThis sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy, that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners, and that our children are going to live in a world where they're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up.\n\nIt conjures up the alarm bells that Benjamin Franklin set off about German immigrants in the late 18th century, who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the English, but would \"swarm into our Settlements, and by herding together establish their Language and Manners to the Exclusion of ours.\" It popped up in the mid-19th century amid worries that Chinese immigrants were \"unassimilable,\" which led to Congress approving the explicitly-named Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.\n\nAnd it helped welcome the 20th century when Massachusetts Sen.\n\nHenry Cabot Lodge warned that immigrants (read: the Irish) were diluting \"the quality of (U.S.) citizenship\" and others complained that Italian immigrants were uneducated, low skilled, apt to send all their money to their home country and prone to criminal activity.\n\nAfter all, Hispanics may be the latest group to find themselves in a culture war with nativists.\n\nRuben Navarrette Jr. is a member of the editorial board of the San Diego Union-Tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.",

the camera then showed a close-up of the destroyed fruit, and then a full-screen shot of him again.\n\nHe waved at the camera and then walked out of view.\n\nThe site indicated that the youth appeared to be fascinated with killing.\n\nAs well as video footage of the Columbine school shootings, it also included clips of the 1993 Waco siege in the United States, the 1995 sarin gas attack in Tokyo, and bombs falling on Baghdad during the 2003 invasion.\n\nMany showed victims being wheeled away or people running for their lives.\n\nThroughout all of this, the single word \"DIE\" constantly flashed across the screen.\n\nIn the rambling text posted on the site, Auvinen said that he is \"a cynical existentialist, anti-human humanist, anti-social social-Darwinist, realistic idealist and god-like atheist. \"I am prepared to fight and die for my cause,\" he wrote. \"I, as a natural selector, will eliminate all who I see unfit, disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection.\" The police said at this afternoon's press conference that they had been fired at when they arrived at the school at 11.45 p.m. local time (9.45 a.m.\n\nThey described the scene as chaotic, with some of the 460 students, ranging in age from 12 to 18, breaking windows in an attempt to escape.\n\nWhen the police's special SWAT unit entered the high school they found the gunman unconscious and in critical condition in the lower lobby of the building with a gunshot wound to his head.\n\nPolice assume he tried to take his own life as no officers fired at him.\n\nSeveral bodies were also found in the same location, where the shooting is believed to have begun, they added.\n\nThey could not confirm comments by some students that Auvinen was firing through doors.\n\nPolice also said that the gun Auvinen used, which was fully licensed, had been purchased less than a month ago on October 19.\n\nThe legal age limit to own a gun in Finland is 18, which Auvinen passed in June of this year.\n\nHe had a recommendation from a shooting club when he obtained the gun, police added, and practised sharp-shooting as a hobby at a shooting range.\n\nFinland, which enjoys a strong tradition of hunting, has a high proportion of gun ownership, with two million firearms owned in a nation of only five million.\n\nThe Associated Press reported comments from Kim Kiuru, one of the school's teachers, on radio station YLE.\n\nKiuru described how the headmistress used the public address system around noon to tell pupils to stay in classrooms.\n\nHe said he locked his classroom door, then waited in the corridor for more news. \"After that I saw the gunman running with what appeared to be a small-caliber handgun in his hand through the doors towards me, after which I escaped to the corridor downstairs and ran in the opposite direction, \" Kiuru said.\n\nThe agency reported Kiuru as saying that he saw a woman's body as he fled the school, before telling his pupils to leave the building through the windows.\n\nAll rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.",

    "text": "(CNN) -- Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs tried to hang himself earlier this year while he was in jail awaiting trial, according to court documents unsealed by a Utah judge on Tuesday.\n\nSect leader Warren Jeffs arrives in court to hear the verdict against him September 25 in St.\n\nJeffs, the leader and so-called prophet of the 10,000-member Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is now awaiting sentencing after being convicted on two counts of being an accomplice to rape.\n\nThe documents, released by Fifth District Judge James Shumate at the request of the media, also indicate that Jeffs confessed to \"immorality\" with a \"sister\" and a daughter more than 30 years ago.\n\nAmong the documents is a competency report on Jeffs completed in April, in which social worker Eric Nielsen wrote that throughout the month of January, Jeffs refused food and drink and developed ulcers on his knees from kneeling in prayer for hours.\n\nOn January 28, the report said, he attempted to hang himself in his cell.\n\nIn the days following the suicide attempt, while he was on suicide watch, Jeffs on separate occasions threw himself against the wall and banged his head on the wall.\n\nJail transcripts show that Jeffs' suicide attempt came three days after a visit with his brother, Nephi, in which he said, \"I am not the prophet.\n\nI never was the prophet, and I have been deceived by the powers of evil ...\n\nI ask for everyone's forgiveness.\" Jeffs also told his brother: \"Farewell forever.\" The day before that, Jeffs told a follower in a phone conversation that he was \"covered with immorality with a sister and a daughter when I was younger.\" In the FLDS, members call adult women \"sister,\" and Jeffs' meaning was unclear.\n\nJeffs' defense attorneys, who argued against the release of the documents, said in a motion opposing the unsealing of the statements that Jeffs recanted them the following month.\n\nDefense attorneys claim Jeffs' medical condition influenced his state of mind when the statements were made.\n\nThey presented Shumate with a letter from another Jeffs attorney, arguing that the statements' release could influence an Arizona jury when Jeffs stands trial in that state.\n\nJeffs, 51, was convicted in September of being an accomplice to rape.\n\nHe was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marriage to her 19-year-old cousin.\n\nHe faces a sentence of up to life in prison when he is sentenced November 20.\n\nThe FLDS -- which is not affiliated with the mainstream Mormon church -- is based in the side-by-side border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona.\n\nJeffs, a former school headmaster, is the son of the sect's previous president and \"prophet,\" Rulon Jeffs, who died in 2002.\n\nJeffs was on the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives list when he was arrested in August 2006 outside Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nCritics say that inside the FLDS, marriages are arranged for girls as young as 13, and competition for brides may be reduced by exiling male teens and young men.\n\nIf male followers are excommunicated, critics claim, wives and children can be reassigned.\n\nDuring Jeffs' trial, defense attorneys claimed authorities were persecuting Jeffs because of his religious beliefs, including practicing polygamy as the way to heaven.\n\nIf Jeffs disavowed being the prophet of the FLDS, it could cause upheaval within the secretive sect.\n\nHowever, two of his followers who spoke to CNN -- although FLDS members usually do not talk to reporters -- said they do not believe he made the statements. \"He is a perfectly priestly man,\" said a woman who identified herself as Cathy. \"He is a man of God, and we will always love him.\n\nOnce a prophet, always a prophet.\" Her husband, Patrick, told CNN, \"It's hogwash.\n\nI will always consider him my prophet.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "text": "SHANGHAI, China -- Championship leader Lewis Hamilton spun out of the Chinese Grand Prix to send the world title race to a cliffhanger finale in Brazil on October 21.\n\nA disconsolate Lewis Hamilton leaves his car after spinning into the gravel trap in Shanghai.\n\nRookie Hamilton can still clinch the crown with third place in the closing race, but saw his 12-point lead cut to four by McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso in Shanghai.\n\nThe Spaniard finished second behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, who also kept his title hopes alive by moving within seven points of Hamilton.\n\nThe young Briton started the race in pole position and at one stage led Raikkonen by more than eight seconds as he again showed superb skills in the wet conditions.\n\nHowever, the 22-year-old stayed out on the drying track too long in his wet tires, which deteriorated at an alarming rate to let Finland's Raikkonen take the lead.\n\nAnd when Hamilton -- who won in Japan last week to give himself the chance of clinching the title this weekend -- finally headed toward the pit lane, he spun out onto the gravel to end his chances with 25 laps to go.\n\nRaikkonen and Alonso both switched to dry tires on the 32nd of the 56 laps, with the Finn going on to win by by 9.8 seconds for his fifth victory this season -- one more than both Hamilton and Alonso.\n\nRaikkone's team-mate Felipe Massa was third, while fourth place was claimed by Toro Rosso's Sebastien Vettel, who was last week reprimanded for causing an accident in Japan behind the safety car while Hamilton was cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nBritain's Jenson Button was fifth in a Honda ahead of Vettel's team-mate Vitantonio Liuzzi, while Germany's Nick Heidfeld was seventh for BMW Sauber and David Coulthard of Scotland took the final point for Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was still confident he could bounce back after suffering his first retirement of the season. \"I'm sorry for the team but I can still do it, don't worry,\" he said. \"When I got out of the car I was just gutted because it was my first mistake all year, and to do it on the way into the pits was not something I usually do. \"You cannot go through life without making mistakes.\n\nBut I am over it and we look forward to Brazil.\n\nThe team will be working hard to make sure the car is quick enough there, and we still have points in the bag. \"We were having a great race and we didn't know if it was going to rain or not.\n\nThe tyres were getting worse and worse and you could almost see the canvas underneath.\n\nWhen I came into the pits it was like ice, I couldn't do anything about it.\" McLaren boss Ron Dennis refused to blame his driver or his team for the spin-off. \"It's too extreme to say anyone made a mistake in this.\n\nIt has been a very competitive season between our drivers and it will go on for another Grand Prix,\" Dennis said. \"I don't think we did anything dramatically wrong and neither did Lewis.\n\nBut the circuit was considerably drier than the pit lane entrance.\n\nThat's what made the difference. \"It was easy to say that we could have stopped earlier, but would it have made a difference?\n\nAll the top teams -- Ferrari and ourselves -- were trying to get through the rain and straight onto a dry tire.\" Alonso, who qualified for the race in fourth, is seeking to become the third driver to win three world titles. \"The result was good today and the eight points are a help for sure,\" he said. \"I think the championship will still be very difficult because I know it will not be easy to take four points from Lewis. \"I need something dramatic if I want to win.\n\nWith a normal race it will be impossible.\" Raikkonen added: \"We are back in the championship and it will be interesting in the final race. \"Hopefully the car is good and it will be a battle all weekend.\n\nIt is not just up to us though, we saw today that anything can happen, but we are back in the championship.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "text": "(CNN) -- This week MME speaks to the man charged with boosting growth in the Kingdom of Bahrain: Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa.\n\nSheikh Mohammed is concerned the nuclear dispute with Iran is deterring potential investors .\n\nAs chief executive of the Economic Development Board, one of Sheikh Mohammed's main tasks is to ensure Bahrain stays ahead of its competitors.\n\nThe government's pushing ahead with economic reforms to reduce the Kingdom's dependence on oil.\n\nBut with crude prices near $100 a barrel, John Defterios asked whether the appetite for change had diminished.\n\nSM: The reforms are being done for aspirational reasons rather than necessity, so we are trying to enter the post-oil area because we want to.\n\nAnd therefore, because of this aspirational aspect, trying to get to as opposed to people pushing us somewhere we don't want to go.\n\nTraditionally it's been a financial center, but you have Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Dubai even Abu Dhabi emerging in financial services.\n\nSM: The rising tide lifts a lot of places and as the region is booming and growing, financial services are growing throughout the region.\n\nBahrain's strengths have been and will continue to be its human capital, the people that have led the financial sector and the long standing regulations that have been established in Bahrain.\n\nJD: Strategically and a geopolitical question here: the Crown Prince came out and declared what Iran's intentions really are -- in his view -- for a nuclear policy, and called for greater diplomacy right ahead of a visit by the President of Iran to the country.\n\nSM: We feel that the distraction caused by the Iranian nuclear issue is holding investment back in the region as a whole, and increasing the security threat of the region.\n\nNobody is debating the right to peaceful nuclear power, but we all have that need and we all need a peaceful resolution to this.\n\nJD: Historically, Iran has even made claims against Bahrain, what do you do now moving forward now?\n\nDo you bring Russia, China, the United States and the European Union closer together, in terms of where we should be going in the future?\n\nSM: We've resolved our historical issue with Iran, and we are well beyond that, but going forward...\n\nThis is such a important issue affecting security worldwide, that we feel it is important and at a level high enough that we need all powers involved because it does affect everybody.\n\nJD: Can the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) become much tighter as an organization to have a voice in that process; as opposed to speaking from the sidelines and hoping that the major powers move forward?\n\nSM: Absolutely, I mean, the GCC is speaking with a unified voice.\n\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia came out with a proposal for providing nuclear fuel from an independent authority; this was completely backed from the GCC.\n\nWe are all moving forward and are willing to play a beneficial role to resolve this issue.\n\nSheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa is chief executive of the Economic Development Board, the organization responsible for stimulating and supporting growth of the Bahraini economy.\n\nHe was appointed in June 2005, following 10 years working directly for His Highness Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Crown Prince, Commander-in-Chief of the Bahrain Defense Force and Chairman of the Economic Development Board.\n\nFrom 1995 to 1999, he was director of the Crown Prince's office.\n\nIn 1999, he was appointed head of the court and also deputy head of the Crown Prince's International Scholarship Program.\n\nDuring this time, Sheikh Mohammed was heavily involved with the Crown Prince's initiatives to liberalize the telecommunications sector and with labor market and economic reforms.\n\nA keen motor sports enthusiast, Sheikh Mohammed was deputy board chairman of the Bahrain International Circuit and is a former vice president of the Bahrain Motor Club, now known as the Bahrain Motor Federation.\n\nSheikh Mohammed, who is married with two sons and one daughter, was born on April 14, 1969.\n\nIn 1992, he received a bachelor's degree in economic theory from the American University, Washington DC.\n\nTwo years later, he received a post-graduate diploma in business studies from the London School of Economics.

    "text": "ALGIERS, Algeria (CNN) -- Rescuers are sifting through the rubble of the United Nations headquarters in Algiers hoping to find survivors after a powerful bomb ripped off the building's facade and leveled nearby U.N. offices.\n\nRescuers and bomb experts search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building.\n\nIt was one of two suspected car bombs that struck Algiers within 10 minutes of each other.\n\nThe death toll is unclear: the official government count is at least 26, but hospital sources in Algiers told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that 76 people were killed in the two blasts.\n\nA statement from the United Nations said 45 people were reported killed.\n\nAlgerian Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni blamed a militant Islamic group with ties to al Qaeda for the attacks, which also targeted a building housing Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court.\n\nIn a posting on an Islamist Web site, the group al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility.\n\nCNN could not immediately corroborate that claim, but the Web site is known to carry messages, claims and videos from al Qaeda and other militant groups.\n\nIn the posting, the bombers were identified as Sheikh Ibrahim Abu Othman and Abdel Rahman Abu Abdel Nasser al-Asimi.\n\nIt said two trucks were filled with \"no less than 800 kg (1,763 pounds) of explosives.\" The group called the operation \"another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood, defending the wounded Islamic nation and in defiance to the Crusaders and their agents, the slaves of America and the sons of France.\" At least 10 U.N. staffers were among those killed, according to U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe.\n\nThe offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees -- located across the street from the U.N. headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m.\n\nET) Tuesday. \"Our offices are basically destroyed now, nothing works,\" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said from its Geneva headquarters.\n\nHe said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped U.N. workers. \"It's a very serious situation still with the U.N. in Algiers,\" he said.\n\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned what he called \"an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity's highest ideals under the U.N. banner.\" \"The perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate punishment -- by Algerian authorities and the international community,\" Ban said in the written statement.\n\nHe said he has sent senior advisers and other top U.N. officials to head to Algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort.\n\nMost of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing near the Constitutional Council -- which oversees elections -- and Supreme Court in the Algiers neighborhood of Ben Aknoun, according to the state-run Algeria Press Agency.\n\nThat blast struck a bus outside the targeted building, killing many of those on board, the news agency reported.\n\nOne man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him. \"I saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me.\n\nI had to run away from the car,\" he said.\n\nZerhouni said the attack was the work of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), the same group that took responsibility for an attack in April in downtown Algiers that killed 33 people.\n\nThat group also uses the name al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb after merging with al Qaeda earlier this year.\n\nIt abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabbing blasts after it joined with al Qaeda.\n\nCNN International Security Correspondent Paula Newton said the merger combined the expertise of Algerian guerrillas with the operational ability of al Qaeda in North Africa, enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of Algiers.\n\nShe said the group's goal is to destabilize countries like Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, which it sees as enemies of the Islamic state.\n\nZerhouni said police interrogations of GSPC members arrested in the wake of the April attack revealed that Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court were on a list of GSPC targets.\n\nAlgeria, which has a population of 33 million, is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an Islamist party was poised to win.\n\nTens of thousands of people died in the unrest.\n\nAlthough the country has remained relatively peaceful, recent terrorist attacks have raised fears of a slide back to violence.",

    "title": "Re-designed Fuji Speedway to host its first Japanese Grand Prix since 1977 .",
    "text": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- There are some circuits that are cornerstones of the Formula 1 calendar: the Monacos and Silverstones whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers.\n\nThen there are the newer circuits -- Malaysia and Bahrain, for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins.\n\nFuji Speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view.\n\nNext week they have something completely new to contend with: a track that has yet to see a single F1 team put in a single lap.\n\nThe Japan Grand Prix is to return to the Fuji Speedway, a circuit that hasn't seen an F1 race since 1977 (though now with a substantially different track layout).\n\nThe Fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games.\n\nThe old Fuji Speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game Pole Position (released by Namco in Japan and Atari in the rest of the world).\n\nThe most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest mountain, looming in the distance.\n\nThough the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies.\n\nThe Suzuka track -- which had held Japanese Grands Prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike, but for this year and the next the Japanese Grand Prix will be held at Fuji.\n\nHowever an announcement by Formula One Management (FOM) this month revealed that Suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the Japanese Grand Prix alternating yearly between Fuji and Suzuka after that.\n\nBehind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with F1 connections -- Honda owns Suzuka, Toyota owns Fuji.\n\nToyota is a relative newcomer to F1 but, having this year surpassed General Motors as the world's number one automobile manufacturer, and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock (a position that hasn't been reflected in sporting success), it is not without clout.\n\nThe redesign of the Fuji track was carried out by Hermann Tilke in 2003.\n\nTilke, a German architect redesigned a number of F1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including Malaysia, Istanbul, Bahrain and Shanghai, and the tracks for 2008's debut grands prix in Singapore and Valencia.\n\nSo how do F1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as Fuji without data from previous races to fall back on?\n\nComputer-aided design (CAD) is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars.\n\nEvery bend, every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself.\n\nDespite never having raced on the circuit, the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual Fuji Speedway for some time.\n\nBMW Sauber's simulation experts received CAD data from the Japanese race organizers late last year.\n\nAnd when their cars arrive at Fuji for testing next week, their race set-up should be close to optimum.\n\nThe circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments.\n\nThe radius of each individual segment was measured, allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line (the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance).\n\nThen the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated.\n\nThe slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car. \"In order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend, we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels, gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance,\" says Willy Rampf, Technical Director of the BMW Sauber F1 Team.\n\nDieter Glass, Chief Race and Test Engineer with Toyota F1 explains: . \"You start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit.\n\nOnce you know that, you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce, before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions. \"Getting a bit closer to the weekend, you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy.\n\nThis prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track, like the degradation of the two Bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time.\n\nIf you have more fuel in the car, this affects your lap time, but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried.\" One peculiarity of the Fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight, which at 1.475 km (0.916 miles) will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but, after the straight the track is relatively twisty.\n\nThe teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight, and the best grip decelerating into the bends. \"You have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip,\" says Glass, \"and as always you want good grip in general, but you have to balance that with the long straight, where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed.\" The testing may be virtual, but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair's breadth away from real world eventualities: . \"Our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values,\" says Rampf.\n\nNot that everything can be predicted: \"I think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race,\" continues Glass. \"Many incidents can happen, which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House is blasting Congressional Democrats for not sending a bill that would fund veterans' care programs to the president's desk by Veterans Day.\n\nThe White House's Dana Perino accused Democrats of holding veterans care funding hostage. \"There's absolutely no reason that the veterans' bill could not have been signed by the president today, except for the political games that the Democrats decided to play with it,\" White House press secretary Dana Perino said Sunday in Crawford, Texas.\n\nCongressional Democrats had attached legislation funding veterans programs to a $150.7 billion bill that also funded a number of domestic priorities, including health, labor and education.\n\nDemocrats also added $3.7 billion to what the president budgeted for veterans programs.\n\nThe labor-health-education bill would increase funding by more than $10 billion over last year's funding for those programs.\n\nThe president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending.\n\nThe House passed a health-labor-education bill 269-142 last week with the veterans funding attached, but the Senate later voted to strip out the veterans funding and send the health-labor-education bill to the president.\n\nPerino accused the Democrats of \"trying to hold hostage our veterans to extra domestic spending or increases in taxes.\" \"The president wants clean legislation, a clean bill to fund the veterans,\" Perino said.\n\nOn Saturday, the Democratic congressional leadership sent a letter to President Bush saying they welcomed a dialogue on spending, sayings disagreements over funding levels \"have never been so great that we cannot reach agreement on a spending plan that meets the needs of the American people.\" \"Key to this dialogue, however, is some willingness on your part to actually find common ground,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said in the letter.\n\nThe leadership said last year's Congress, which was still under Republican control, had never passed a separate bill funding veterans programs.\n\nCongress also sent to the president legislation that would fund veterans care at the levels requested by the president through December 14, the leadership said.\n\nThe current funding level \"is still below the $3.9 billion extra that we passed,\" said Nadeam Elshami, spokesman Pelosi. \"We are committed to getting the extra funding that the Congress already voted on the president's desk for his signature.\" The leadership blamed Republican members of Congress for stalling the funding for the veterans programs by blocking its inclusion in the larger spending bill.\n\nPerino, though, said the Democrats could still send a separate bill to the president funding the veterans program that passed both chambers of Congress. \"The Democrats decided not to send the president this bill,\" Perino said. \"That has to be laid at their feet.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. first lady Laura Bush -- in a rare foray into foreign policy -- called on Myanmar's military junta to \"step aside,\" give up the \"terror campaigns\" against its people and allow for a democratic Myanmar in a commentary published in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal.\n\nU.S. first lady Laura Bush said the junta \"should step aside to make way for a unified Burma.\" \"Gen.\n\nThan Shwe and his deputies are a friendless regime,\" Bush said. \"They should step aside to make way for a unified Burma [Myanmar] governed by legitimate leaders. \"The rest of the armed forces should not fear this transition -- there is room for a professional military in a democratic Burma,\" Bush said, in keeping with the U.S. policy of still using Myanmar's former name.\n\nIn Wednesday's commentary, Bush called on Myanmar's military leaders to release Aun Sung Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders so they can meet with and plan for a transition to democracy. \"Meanwhile, the world watches -- and waits,\" Bush warns. \"We know that Gen.\n\nThan Shwe and his deputies have the advantage of violent force.\n\nSuu Kyi and other opposition leaders have moral legitimacy, the support of the Burmese people and the support of the world. \"The regime's position grows weaker by the day.\n\nThe generals' choice is clear: The time for a free Burma is now.\" The humanitarian rights situation in Myanmar has been a cause for the first lady in the past few months as the crisis there worsened.\n\nMyanmar state media has reported that 2,000 people were detained during the demonstrations and the crackdown against them -- under an emergency law imposed on September 25 banning assembly of more than five people -- and that 700 of those people have been released.\n\nThe official death toll from Myanmar's leadership is at 10, but there are reports that hundreds were killed and thousands arrested in the wake of the demonstrations that peaked late September, which were led by Myanmar's Buddhist monks.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Bush received a phone call from U.N.\n\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon to update her on the efforts of his special envoy to Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari.\n\nA representative of the secretary general said the call was a follow-up to a conversation they had weeks ago.\n\nGambari met last week with the military junta leadership as well as with Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest in Yangon.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, told reporters that Laura Bush and her husband's administration believe that there is a \"need to start preparing for transition\" for Myanmar. \"We believe it is very important that progress be made and prisoners be released and conditions for Aun Sung Suu Kyi be improved [so] that she can prepare for participation for negotiations for a transition,\" he said.",

    "title": "Bush says most of Congress \"acting like a teenager with a new credit card\"",
    "text": "NEW ALBANY, Indiana (CNN) -- President Bush vetoed a $600 billion spending bill Tuesday, accusing Democratic leaders of wasting money and plotting tax increases, then took his budget fight with Congress on the road.\n\nCongress should cut spending \"and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law,\" President Bush said. \"The majority was elected on a pledge of fiscal responsibility, but so far, it's acting like a teenager with a new credit card,\" he said in a speech in New Albany, Indiana.\n\nThe bill -- which Bush said was laden with $10 billion in \"pork\" -- would have funded the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services.\n\nIt also would have funded projects such as a prison museum, a sailing school and a program to teach Portuguese. \"Congress needs to cut out that pork, reduce the spending and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law,\" the president said.\n\nWhile polls show Bush's popularity remains at near-record lows, Congress ranks even lower as a whole.\n\nThe president has taken numerous opportunities to mock the spending habits of the Democratic leadership and force confrontations over the appropriations bills needed to fund the government for the 2008 budget year, which began October 1.\n\nThe bill Bush vetoed Tuesday includes about $150 billion to run those departments and more than $450 billion in mandatory spending on Medicare and Medicaid, the federal health care programs for the elderly and poor, according to the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nDavid Obey, called Bush's veto \"not responsible and not credible.\" \"This is a bipartisan bill supported by over 50 Republicans,\" Obey, D-Wisconsin, said in a statement issued after the veto. \"There has been virtually no criticism of its contents.\n\nIt is clear the only reason the president vetoed this bill is pure politics.\" Bush said Democrats are supporting $22 billion in additional spending beyond his budget proposals this year and $205 billion over five years -- money he said would ultimately be raised by tax increases. \"When the bill for all that spending comes due, Congress is going to turn to the working people, to the small-business owners and the entrepreneurs,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's veto is the fifth cast since Democrats took control of Congress in 2006.\n\nCongress has overridden one of those, voting last week to authorize $23 billion in water projects nationwide over the president's objections.\n\nDemocrats will schedule another override vote this week, an aide to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said.\n\nBut Antonia Ferrier, spokeswoman for House Republican Whip Roy Blunt, said Bush's GOP allies are confident they will be able to sustain the veto.\n\nBush signed a $470 billion Pentagon spending bill that covers the Defense Department's normal operations, but Democrats split $50 billion in spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan off into a \"bridge fund\" to which they plan to attach demands for Bush to withdraw U.S. combat troops.\n\nThe measure sets up another confrontation with the White House.\n\nBush also demanded Congress reform the alternative minimum tax -- a measure originally aimed at preventing the wealthy from evading taxes, but one that increasingly affects middle-class earners -- without raising additional revenue.\n\nCharles Rangel, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to eliminate the tax was unacceptable. \"Preventing a tax increase in one area should not be an excuse for raising taxes in other areas,\" he said. \"Congress should eliminate the tax increases in the bill and send the AMT relief to my desk as soon as possible.\" The elimination of the tax would cause an estimated $800 billion to be lost over 10 years.\n\nTo replace that, Rangel's bill would add a 4 percent surtax on individual incomes over $100,000, after deductions, and close corporate tax loopholes.\n\nThe bill also would cut rates for many individual and corporate taxpayers.\n\nRepublicans have already started calling it \"the mother of all tax increases.\" \"With all the other pressures on our economy, raising taxes is one of the most unwise things Congress could possibly do,\" Bush said.\n\nBush acknowledged the difficulties Americans face from high fuel prices, a \"challenged\" housing market and \"uncertainty\" in financial markets stemming from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market -- \"but as we have seen in recent years, this economy is resilient, and that's important for the American people to understand.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "text": "DENVER, Colorado -- A Colorado man terrorized by threats after testifying against his daughter's abusive boyfriend says he has spent $10,000 on a security system, hired a bodyguard for his son's wedding and never leaves home without a .45-caliber handgun strapped to his chest.\n\nKeith Reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case.\n\nThe man, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case, says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of Keith Reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family.\n\nA report in the Denver Post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of Colorado.\n\nPaul Logli, chairman of National District Attorneys Association, told Congress this year that witness intimidation has become \"almost epidemic,\" according to the Denver Post.\n\nWhen asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of Colorado's witness protection program, the witness in the Reynolds case said, \"All they told us was maybe we should move.\" \"I'm pretty sure I told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program.\n\nI can't remember if I gave them all the details.\" the prosecutor assigned to the case, who didn't want to be named, told CNN.\n\nAfter Reynolds' conviction, the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home.\n\nThey received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked.\n\nThe couple received a death threat from Reynolds himself through the mail.\n\nWatch witness describe fear of being targeted » .\n\nReynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation.\n\nHowever, it is likely he'll be released within five years.\n\nNo national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist, and minimal research has been conducted on the subject.\n\nThe latest National Institute of Justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem.\n\nColorado has $50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget.\n\nIn contrast, the city of Denver spent almost $100,000 on landscaping last year.\n\nThe state, on average, spends about $1,000 per witness.\n\nThat figure supposedly includes moving expenses, rent, and furniture.\n\nThe federal program spends in excess of $40 million per year on witness protection.\n\nOne possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities, as do federal witnesses. \"It's not designed to be a long-term relocation at the public's expense; it's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses,\" according to Peter Weir, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety.\n\nColorado's witness protection program is a \"joke,\" according to The Rev.\n\nLeon Kelly, founder and executive director of the Open Door Youth Gang Alternatives.\n\nKelly says the state doesn't provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward.\n\nMore than a decade ago, a young man named Darryl Givens asked Kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison.\n\nA few months later, he was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends.\n\nRhonda Fields says failures in the witness protection program may have contributed to her son's murder.\n\nJavad Fields was a college graduate who was engaged to be married.\n\nHe had plans to move east when a Fourth of July barbecue in 2004 in changed all that.\n\nHe witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing.\n\nJavad Fields and his fiancee were gunned down while driving along a suburban street in Aurora, Colorado.\n\nRhonda Fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program.\n\nFields told CNN, \"I asked them what happened.\n\nWhy weren't any measures taken to safeguard his life?\n\nAnd I was told he never asked for any protection.\" Javad's mother does not think it was her son's responsibility to ask for protection. \"I think it's the authorities' responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness,\" she said.\n\nField's case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program.\n\nProsecutors filed an order for protection requesting Javad Fields' personal information be kept secret, but it wasn't signed by a judge until one year later, after defense lawyers had already given the suspects Fields' personal information, along with crucial trial documents. \"I felt like the DA's office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life,\" Rhonda Fields told CNN.\n\nDistrict Attorney Carol Chambers maintains the program has improved.\n\nShe says a notice about witness protection is now attached to every subpoena, ensuring witnesses are aware of their options.\n\nThat didn't start, however, until two years after Javad Fields was killed.",

    "text": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Previously unseen footage of Diana, Princess of Wales, taken just hours before she was killed in a car crash, has been shown to the jury at the inquest into her death.\n\nThe footage showed Diana and Dodi step into an elevator at the Ritz Hotel.\n\nImages taken from a security camera at the Ritz Hotel in Paris show the 36-year-old smiling as she and her lover Dodi Fayed step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel.\n\nFurther footage shows Fayed visiting a jeweler's shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring.\n\nEarlier, a British coroner at the inquest said tt may never be known for certain whether Princess Diana was pregnant when she died in the Paris car crash.\n\nLord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover Dodi Fayed that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate \"one way or the other\" whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy.\n\nBut he said they would hear \"intimate\" details of her personal life.\n\nBaker told the 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Diana may have been on the contraceptive pill and that evidence she was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory.\n\nOn Tuesday the judge, who is acting as coroner in the case, told the jury that a famous image taken in summer 1997 showing Diana wearing a swimsuit could not be proof she was pregnant with Dodi's child as she had not started a relationship with him at that stage.\n\nThe jury is set to hear \"scene setting\" evidence, including CCTV and a tourist video.\n\nThe inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a six-month process.\n\nFayed's father, Mohammed Al Fayed, has contended from the start that Diana and his son were murdered because the royal family \"could not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be step-father to the future king of England,\" referring to Diana's son Prince William. \"I'm hoping for justice,\" Al Fayed said outside court. \"At last, we're going to have a jury from ordinary people and I hope to reach the decision which I believe that my son and Princess Diana have been murdered by the royal family.\" Baker told the jury of Al Fayed's allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case, but not to assign blame or guilt. \"You have to decide four important, but limited factual questions: who the deceased were, when they came by their deaths, where they came by their deaths and how they came by their deaths,\" Baker said, according to inquest transcripts. \"The first three questions are unlikely to give rise to any difficulty.\n\nThe fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they died.\" Diana, 36, and 42-year-old Dodi Fayed were killed on August 31, 1997 when the Mercedes-Benz they were traveling in hit a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris.\n\nThey were being pursued at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the Ritz Hotel.\n\nDriver Henri Paul, who was also killed, was drunk and driving at high speed.\n\nNext week, the jury is scheduled to travel to Paris to see the crash site, along the River Seine.\n\nThey are also expected to hear testimony from the paparazzi who were present after the accident.\n\nIn its evidence section, the Web site for the inquest has posted previously unpublished pictures taken by paparazzi of the limo before and immediately after the accident.\n\nOne is a closeup -- looking into the front of the vehicle -- that shows Diana, Fayed, Paul and Rees-Jones minutes before the crash.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republicans reacted with surprise and recrimination Sunday to blistering criticism of the Iraq war from former coalition commander retired Lt.\n\nRicardo Sanchez on Sunday after he criticized the war effort.\n\nOn Friday, Sanchez, who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004, called the Iraq war \"a nightmare with no end in sight.\" He said the Bush administration, the State Department and Congress all share blame.\n\nSpeaking with military reporters in Virginia, Sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial, but the politicians have not been held accountable. \"I'm astounded, really,\" South Carolina Republican Sen.\n\nLindsey Graham on CNN's \"Late Edition\" with Wolf Blitzer on Sunday.\n\nGraham, who recently returned from Baghdad, said he and GOP presidential candidate Sen.\n\nJohn McCain had visited Sanchez several times in 2003 and 2004. \"Every time we talked to Gen.\n\nSanchez, we got pushback -- we have enough troops; Guard and reserves aren't being strained,\" Graham said.\n\nHe added that Sanchez's own record in Iraq is blemished: Abu Ghraib \"got out of control under his watch.\n\nThe war in general got out of control under his watch.\" But Graham said that \"finally,\" with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional U.S. troops since January, \"We are getting it right.\" Sanchez told reporters that American political leaders have cost American lives on the battlefield with their \"lust for power.\" Sanchez said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty, but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired. \"While the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power, our soldiers die,\" he said.\n\nThat brought a tart response from McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"I wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time,\" McCain told CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" He said Sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but \"unfortunately, that doesn't happen very often.\" One of the reasons few speak out, he said, is evidenced by what happened to former Army Chief of Staff Gen.\n\nShinseki was sidelined after telling Congress that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy Iraq.\n\nMitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, told ABC's \"This Week\" that Sanchez is simply wrong. \"My definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror,\" he said. \"I think we're making significant progress toward that end.\" But, he added, \"I think the central government in Iraq has been an embarrassment.\n\nThey've not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for.\" Graham said he hopes the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki will \"step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year.\" If that does not happen, he said, \"it will be incumbent upon us, as a nation, to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable Iraq.\" That brought a blistering response from Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under President Carter. \"What is this?\n\nThis is a colony,\" he said. \"That's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter.\" Even those Iraqis who were happy to see Saddam Hussein toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing U.S. presence, Brzezinski said.\n\nThough some countries are willing to go along with the United States, \"No one in the world really supports our policy in Iraq,\" he said.\n\nIn his Friday speech, Sanchez added that the \"surge\" of U.S. troops into Iraq represents \"a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war.\" National Security Council spokeswoman Kate Starr did not address the comment.\n\nInstead, she said, \"We appreciate his service to the country.\n\nPetraeus and Ambassador Crocker said, there's more work to be done but progress is being made in Iraq.\n\nAnd that's what we're focused on now.\" Gen.\n\nDavid Petraeus is the U.S. top commander in Iraq.\n\nRyan Crocker is the U.S. ambassador to Iraq.",

    "text": "PETERSBURG, Florida (CNN) -- The acrimony from the Republican campaign trail carried over quickly into the CNN/YouTube GOP presidential debate Wednesday.\n\nThe debate marked the first time the candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month.\n\nWith five weeks to go until the first contest of the 2008 nominating season, the Republican candidates engaged in a free-for-all, trying to differentiate their views on immigration, the Iraq war, abortion, gun control and even whether they believed every word in the Bible was true.\n\nUnlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, Wednesday night's attacks were launched at each other.\n\nFormer New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov.\n\nMitt Romney traded jabs over illegal immigration, something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month.\n\nRomney attacked Giuliani's record, saying that as mayor, he promoted illegal immigration.\n\nAnd Giuliani shot back, accusing Romney of having a \"sanctuary mansion\" at his own home.\n\nWatch the debate format produce raw moments » . \"In his case, there were six sanctuary cities.\n\nThere was a sanctuary mansion -- at his own home, illegal immigrants were being employed,\" Giuliani said.\n\nRomney denied Giuliani's allegation, and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other.\n\nIn his quest to appeal to the hard-line immigration wing of the party, Romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former Arkansas Gov.\n\nMike Huckabee, who has been rising in the polls.\n\nTom Tancredo, who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration, seemed delighted with the give and take, saying the other candidates were trying to \"out-Tancredo\" him.\n\nHuckabee drew one of the night's largest cheers when he said that one of the agencies he would abolish to control federal spending was the Internal Revenue Service. \"Most people in this country are more afraid of an audit than they are of a mugging, and there's a reason why,\" he said.\n\nJohn McCain, freshly back from a visit to Iraq over Thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates, and Rep.\n\nRon Paul, the most anti-war of the candidates, tangled on two occasions over the Iraq war.\n\nDid YouTubers get their questions answered? » .\n\nAsked which government programs they would cut, Paul said bringing the troops home from Iraq would save \"a trillion dollars.\" McCain said: \"It's that kind of isolationism that caused World War II,\" which drew some hoots from the crowd.\n\nPaul replied: \"The real question you have to ask is why do I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel?\" A retired brigadier general, Keith Kerr, who is gay, asked candidates if they thought U.S. military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops.\n\nCNN later learned that a June media release from the campaign of Democratic front-runner Clinton listed Kerr as a member of its steering committee for gay and lesbian supporters.\n\nWatch Kerr deny that the Clinton campaign influenced his question » .\n\nDavid Bohrman, CNN senior vice president and executive producer of the debate, said, \"We regret this incident.\n\nCNN would not have used the general's question had we known that he was connected to any presidential candidate.\" Political Ticker .\n\nKerr told CNN after the debate that he has not worked for the Clinton campaign and was representing no one other than himself.\n\nKerr also said he is a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a national gay and lesbian Republican grass-roots organization.\n\nPrior to the debate, CNN had verified Kerr's military background and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate.\n\nIn a section of the debate about gun ownership rights, three of the GOP presidential hopefuls said they do not own guns: McCain, Giuliani and Romney.\n\nFred Thompson quipped, \"I own a couple of guns -- but I'm not going to tell you what they are or where they are.\" Watch the candidates address gun control » .\n\nThe debate turned personal when a viewer, holding the Bible, asked: \"Do you believe every word of this book?\n\nAnd I mean specifically, this book that I am holding in my hand.\" Huckabee, a Baptist minister, said, \"Sure, I believe the Bible is exactly what it is.\" Giuliani said he believes the Bible, but not \"literally true in every respect.\" After that, Romney stammered a bit when moderator Anderson Cooper asked him if he believed every word.\n\nWatch the candidates get personal about the Bible » . \"Yeah, the Bible is the word of God. ...\n\nI might interpret the word differently than you interpret the word, but I read the Bible and I believe the Bible is the word of God,\" Romney said.\n\nWhen asked about abortion, Romney said he was wrong in favoring a woman's right to choose -- his position when he was elected governor of Massachusetts. \"If people in this country are looking for someone who's never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit they're ever wrong, they're going to have to find somebody else.\n\nHis remarks came in response to the 30-second video produced for the debate by Thompson's campaign, which included a clip of Romney expressing support for Roe vs.\n\nWhen asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal, Paul said it was not an issue for the president or the federal government. \"We don't need a federal abortion police, that's the last thing we need,\" Paul said.\n\nHe added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities.\n\nOn the issues of taxes, Thompson said he'd \"never met a tax he liked.\" \"I've got a tax-cut bill on the table.\n\nBut I don't do pledges to anybody but the American people,\" he said.\n\nHis response was met by a \"Go, Fred, go!\" from a member of the audience.\n\nDuncan Hunter said China is \"cheating on trade ... and it's in the interest of the United States to stop China's cheating.\n\nBuy American this Christmas season -- that might keep your neighbor from losing his job.\" The candidates fielded video questions submitted by the public via the YouTube Web site, just as Democratic White House candidates did in July.\n\nThe debate was the first time the GOP candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month.\n\nCNN's political team viewed nearly 5,000 videos for the GOP debate -- about 2,000 more than they saw for the Democrats' debate.",

    "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- None of the 1,000-plus Iraqi detainees freed in recent weeks have broken a pledge not to return to the insurgency, according to the Marine general who oversees the U.S. detention centers in Iraq.\n\nA U.S. military panel reviews a detainee's case at Camp Cropper near Baghdad.\n\nDoug Stone on Wednesday reassured Iraqis about how the 25,000 detainees -- mostly Sunnis -- are treated after being taken into custody on suspicion of involvement in the insurgency.\n\nStone described the detention system as \"open and transparent,\" saying it makes the detainees better citizens and helps break the cycle of violence and poverty in the country.\n\nStone said detainees get free medical care equal to what he gets as a general, food and water made to Islamic standards, educational opportunities, jobs skills and contact with families.\n\nThe U.S. detention centers -- at Camp Bucca near the southern port city of Basra and in Camp Cropper near Baghdad -- are political sore points for Sunnis, who make up 83 percent of the detainees held.\n\nThe main Sunni political coalition -- the Iraqi Accord Front -- cited the centers as one reason for quitting the government during the summer.\n\nLast month, the U.S.-led coalition launched Operation Lion's Paw in which between 50 and 70 detainees would be released daily during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan after taking a pledge not to rejoin the insurgency against the Shiite-led government. \"This pledge is an Iraqi pledge, a pledge before an Iraqi judge, frequently with a family member present,\" Stone said. \"I am pleased to tell you that in the more 1,000 that have gone through this program and taken the pledge, not one has returned to threaten Iraqi or coalition forces.\" Stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond Ramadan.\n\nStone's description seems a far cry from the Abu Ghraib prison operated by the U.S. military in the first years after the invasion.\n\nThat prison was closed down and razed in the wake of an international scandal over prisoner abuse. \"There are no secrets that go on in detention,\" Stone said. \"Our facilities are open to inspection by any agency that we in the federal government believe is credible.\n\nThese agencies are welcomed because they are windows for the world.\" See what life's like inside Camp Cropper's walls » .\n\nBy the time of their release, \"detainees grow in terms of working in an inter-sectarian environment,\" he said.\n\nEach detainee has a chance to take classes up to a sixth-grade level, and high school classes are being planned, Stone said.\n\nAbout one-third -- or 8,000 -- are in school, with 7,000 having passed the fifth-grade level, he said.\n\nThe 860 detainees who are 17 or younger are all in school, Stone said.\n\nThe average stay for a detainee is 300 days, but some have been detained for two years or longer, he said.\n\nA review board interviews detainees to decide if they are a threat to security, he said.\n\nIf they are deemed not to be, they are offered freedom in exchange for taking the pledge.\n\nOnly 280 detainees are foreigners, mostly from Syria, Egypt, Iran, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, he said.",

    "text": "(CNN) -- The Tennessee Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to modify or overturn a lower court's ruling allowing Mary Winkler, convicted of killing her minister husband, visitation rights with the couple's three daughters.\n\nHolding baby Brianna, Mary Winkler stands next to Matthew.\n\nIn the foreground are Mary Alice and Patricia.\n\nCharles and Diane Winkler, parents of slain minister Matthew Winkler, had asked the court to intervene and either revoke Mary Winkler's visitation rights or allow them to proceed only under supervision of a counselor.\n\nThe children -- Patricia, Mary Alice and Brianna -- have been living with their grandparents since their mother was arrested last year.\n\nWinkler has not seen the children in 15 months, said Kay Farese Turner, her attorney.\n\nShe said her client was \"absolutely elated about the news and believes this will be her best Christmas ever.\" Turner said she believes the visit may come before Christmas.\n\nA jury convicted Winkler earlier this year of voluntary manslaughter in the shotgun death of Matthew Winkler -- not the first-degree murder conviction prosecutors had wanted.\n\nShe said the slaying came after years of abuse, including physical violence and being forced to dress \"slutty\" for undesirable sex acts.\n\nWinkler received a three-year sentence, but a judge required her to serve only 210 days, gave her credit for the five months she had already served and allowed her to serve the remaining 60 days in a mental health facility.\n\nAt the time of their father's death in March 2006, Patricia was 8, Mary Alice was 6 and Brianna was 1.\n\nCharles and Diane Winkler have moved to terminate Mary Winkler's rights and have filed a $2 million wrongful death suit against her for their son's slaying.\n\nThe termination issue has not been decided in court.\n\nTurner said the court may want to determine what, if any, bond Winkler has with her children before making a decision.\n\nAttempts by CNN to contact attorneys for the Winklers were not immediately successful Wednesday.\n\nIn September, a lower court granted Winkler visitation with her daughters pending the outcome of the custody battle.\n\nThe court specified the visits be supervised by a guardian ad litem appointed to represent the children's interests and supervised by members of the couple Winkler is living with or by her sister.\n\nA subsequent appeal by the grandparents was denied, leading to their Supreme Court appeal.\n\nThe Winklers said if their former daughter-in-law got visitation with the children at all, it should be under the supervision of a professional counselor.\n\nAt a September hearing, according to court documents, they said the children \"exhibit fear and confusion\" toward their mother \"and her role in their father's death.\" One expert, in testimony, quoted Patricia as saying her mother had killed her father and, \"I don't know if she will kill me.\n\nI want to ask her if she would do that to me.\n\nIt scares me, kind of; if she did, well, I guess I would see my father.\" The Winklers also said that after telephone calls with their mother, the children experienced \"urination accidents, sleeping problems, graphic nightmares and sleepwalking.\" They said the lower court erred by failing to appoint the guardian ad litem until after the September hearing.\n\nTurner, however, said she believes terminating Winkler's parental rights would not be in the children's best interest. \"She has a faith rarely seen, and she loves those children,\" Turner said.\n\nAfter Matthew Winkler's death, Winkler fled with the girls to the Alabama coast, where she was arrested.\n\nShe said during a September appearance on the \"Oprah Winfrey Show\" that she never expected to get away with killing her husband, but that she fled to be with her daughters and \"have some good times.\" E-mail to a friend .",

There has been a lot going right for us, but one or two things going wrong.\n\nWe have to deal with that, and then I will look forward to the rest of the season.\" Third-placed Motherwell missed the chance to move above Rangers after being beaten 3-0 at home by Falkirk, who climbed to ninth with two goals in the second half to Michael Higdon and then another from Patrick Clegg on 65 minutes.\n\nFourth-placed Dundee United failed to take advantage, losing 2-1 at home to bottom club Gretna -- whose only two wins this season have come against the Tangerines.\n\nKenny Deuchar put the visitors ahead in the 12th minute before striker Noel Hunt leveled on 29, and Nicky Deverdics scored the eventual winner for the Borders outfit three minutes before half-time.\n\nInverness Caledonian Thistle followed up last weekend's shock 3-2 victory against Celtic by also winning at Hearts by the same scoreline.\n\nThe visitors led through Russell Duncan after 22 minutes and John Rankin made it 2-0 with a 53rd-minute penalty before Christophe Berra pulled one back on 62 and Lithuanian striker Andrius Velicka leveled from the spot (90).\n\nHowever, Graham Bayne scored a dramatic injury-time winner to lift Caley into the top six.\n\nIn Saturday's other game, second-bottom St Mirren drew 0-0 at home to fellow strugglers Kilmarnock to be left seven points ahead of Gretna.",

    "text": "CARACAS, Venezuela (CNN) -- The price of sin rose Monday in Venezuela where President Hugo Chavez is on a campaign to make Venezuelans cut back on drinking and smoking. \"Everyone's shocked,\" said Leonora Marino, owner of Bodegon Marino in Valencia, Venezuela, west of Caracas.\n\nOn Monday evening, she was still changing the prices in her store as her customers looked on and complained, she told a reporter.\n\nAlcohol is now 10 percent more expensive; cigarettes are 20 percent pricier. \"Really, it's difficult to buy at these prices,\" she said, then joked, \"They say they're going to stop eating so that they can continue drinking.\" The Venezuelan government is placing a higher tax on alcohol and cigarettes in an effort to cut consumption and prevent what it views as the social, economic and moral consequences of drinking and smoking, said Jose Vielma Mora, superintendent of Seniat, the government body that oversees the collection of taxes.\n\nTaxes on whiskey, brandy, cognac and other drinks that don't come from cane sugar have been raised $1.79 (3,838 bolivares) per liter, the government-run Bolivarian News Agency said. \"It's unfair because, in the end, the consumer is the one who pays,\" said Fernando Fernandez, a liquor exporter.\n\nChavez has described whiskey as a drink for rich people, not for revolutionaries. \"We cannot be spending the international reserves of this country on whiskey,\" he said.\n\nThe moves represent the first steps toward transforming each Venezuelan into what Chavez calls \"the new man.\" Chavez has cited the life of revolutionary socialist icon Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara as an example of how to lead a more pure life.\n\nIn April, Chavez told a graduating class of medical students in Caracas, Venezuela, that the level of consumption of alcohol in the country represents a threat to public health and ought to make residents feel ashamed, according to an ABN report. \"The vice causes much harm, not only to individuals, but to the collective health of the nation,\" said Chavez, who said the dangers result in an increase in car wrecks and domestic violence.\n\nFor his part, he has said he drinks too much coffee.\n\nAlso effective Monday, stores near schools, churches and cultural centers will not be granted licenses to sell alcohol.\n\nTaxes on cigarette imports have also increased, from 50 percent to 70 percent of the total price.\n\nOn the street, some people said they don't understand the motivations for the increase, but predicted their consumption would not change. \"The Venezuelan is not going to stop drinking or smoking,\" said one person.\n\nChavez also plans to increase taxes on luxury items such as Hummers, which are imported privately and at great expense.\n\nThere is no Hummer dealership in the country.\n\nHigher oil prices in recent years have translated into higher consumption in petroleum-rich Venezuela.\n\nLast year, car sales increased by about 70 percent, according to the CIA World Factbook.\n\nBut Chavez, who was in Cuba on Monday visiting communist leader Fidel Castro, said he wants to focus less on material goals for Venezuela's 27 million people, 38 percent of whom live in poverty.",

    "text": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Obesity is the No. 1 health crisis in the United States, and the nation could be at risk without immediate action, former President Clinton said at CNN's first Fit Nation Summit.\n\nSanjay Gupta and former President Clinton lead the discussion at the first Fit Nation Summit. \"We need to do something about it for our children, and for our country, because something like this could easily collapse our nation if we don't act now,\" Clinton said.\n\nSanjay Gupta, gathered with experts from across the country Wednesday to explore solutions to America's obesity crisis.\n\nTwo-thirds of adult Americans are overweight or obese; the same is true for one-third of U.S. children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nObesity carries increased risk of myriad health problems, including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and arthritis.\n\nGupta, Clinton and a panel of experts addressed such proposed solutions as healthy school lunches, elimination of trans fats, the need for healthier food in urban communities and the importance of supporting community-based efforts to fight obesity.\n\nWatch Gupta explain the solutions proposed at the Fit Nation Summit » .\n\nClinton, who's been tackling the obesity issue over the past few years with his Alliance for a Healthier Generation, stressed the need to help educate people about the importance of a healthy diet and exercising together.\n\nMotivating Americans, especially kids, won't be easy, Clinton said. \"They need to be handled with care.\n\nKids need to know it's important, but [fitness] can't be boring,\" he said. \"There's no shame, there's no embarrassment.\n\nWe have to let them know it's all good, but you have to do it.\" Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a strong advocate against trans fats in foods, stressed that the Food and Drug Administration should ban trans fats altogether and stop leaving it up to local and state governments.\n\nTrans fats, at one time, thought to be good fat substitutes, over the years have been shown to raise LDL or bad cholesterol in people and lower their HDL, or good cholesterol. \"They're just not good for our health, Jacobson said.\n\nRobert Eckel, former president of the American Heart Association, warned, \"Although we support the removal of trans fats, our biggest concern is what they'll be replaced with.\n\nWe need to think about that, because there will be a substitute.\" The panel took questions from an audience of 150 people -- mostly obesity experts or those who work in industries that deal with obesity.\n\nGupta was inspired to launch Fit Nation, an ongoing, multiplatform, grass-roots initiative against obesity.\n\nOver the past three years, Gupta and the CNN Medical Unit have crisscrossed the country, asking Americans to take charge of their weight by exercising more and eating healthier.\n\nThis year, Gupta traveled from Michigan to California asking the public to pledge to add 1 million hours to their collective lives by getting off the couch and exercising.\n\nSince he began the tour in April, the campaign has surpassed its goal, with exercise pledges close to four times that amount.\n\nGupta said he hopes that legislators and administrators who can make a difference in policy and perhaps change attitudes about obesity will hear the solutions discussed at the summit. \"I''ve covered a lot of stories on obesity,\" Gupta said. \"There's a battle going on, and we need to win the battle.\n\nI've talked to people out there and many are just blasé. \"This is our opportunity to make them care.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "text": "(CNN) -- The man arrested for the videotaped rape of a toddler in Las Vegas, Nevada, will make his initial appearance in court Friday, a Clark County, Nevada, court official told CNN Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities have not yet decided if Chester Arthur Stiles will appear in person or via video link.\n\nThe judge will set a date for the arraignment at that hearing.\n\nStiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving.\n\nA former girlfriend of Stiles' said that, before the arrest, she lived in fear after going to police to identify the suspect after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news. \"I've had my share of nightmares,\" Elaine Thomas told CNN's Nancy Grace.\n\nThomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a \"weapons enthusiast\" with only a minor criminal record.\n\nWatch Thomas say how she felt when she saw the photos » . \"How could I not tell them who that man was?\n\nThat little girl suffered unimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him,\" Thomas said.\n\nThe judge in the case will hold an administrative hearing Wednesday, but Stiles will not be present, Clark County court spokesman Michael Sommermeyer said.\n\nStiles was already being sought on an unrelated 2004 charge of felony lewdness with a child under 14, Sommermeyer said, adding that authorities amended that earlier filing on October 4 to include 20 counts related to the videotaped rape, including sexual assault and attempted sexual assault.\n\nDonohue, the attorney for the girl's mother, told CNN that the child on the videotape was younger than 3 when the abuse occurred.\n\nHenderson Police Officer Mike Dye said he pulled over Stiles' car Monday night because it did not have a license plate and became suspicious when the driver gave him an expired California driver's license with a photo that did not look like him.\n\nDye said he and another officer, Mike Gower, questioned Stiles until he admitted his identity. \"He finally told us, 'Hey, I'm Chester Stiles.\n\nI'm the guy you're looking for,'\" Dye said. \"At that time, he said, 'I'm sick of running.'\" Dye said Stiles was calm and cooperative.\n\nStiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was turned over to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and booked into the jail in Clark County, where he had been sought in connection with the videotape, which shows a girl being sexually assaulted.\n\nThe girl, who is now 7, was found last month after a nationwide search.\n\nThe tape was given to authorities by Darren Tuck, who told police he had found it in the desert five months before handing it over.\n\nBecause of the delay, during which Tuck allegedly showed the tape to others, he faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography.\n\nHe turned himself in to authorities in Nye County, Nevada, earlier this month.\n\nProfessionals have evaluated the girl in the videotape since she was found, and she appears to be \"healthy and fine and happy,\" her mother's attorney said this month.\n\nThe mother had not known her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until late last month, Donohue said. \"A family friend called her and said, 'My God, you need to turn on the TV.\n\nI believe that is your daughter,' \" Donohue said.\n\nDonohue said the mother recognized Stiles, a former animal trainer.\n\nThe alleged abuse most likely occurred while the mother -- a single woman working six days a week -- was at work, Donohue said.\n\nAnother former girlfriend of Stiles', Tina Allen, said this month she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is \"mortified\" by the allegations against him. \"He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,\" Allen said.\n\nAllen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived.\n\nAlso living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, the alleged assault victim.\n\nTodd Allen, Tina Allen's son, said he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video.",

    "title": "Sailor's wife could be deported while he's overseas .",
    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Florida (CNN) -- Eduardo Gonzalez, a petty officer second class with the U.S.\n\nNavy, is about to be deployed overseas for a third time.\n\nMaking his deployment even tougher is the fact his wife may not be around when he comes back.\n\nMildred and Eduardo Gonzalez worry about what would happen to their family if she is deported.\n\nHis wife faces deportation to Guatemala -- her home country that she hasn't seen since 1989.\n\nHe also doesn't know what would happen to his young son, Eduardo Jr., if that happens. \"I like being in uniform and serving my country, but if she goes back I'm going to have to give it all up and just get out and take care of my son and get a job,\" he said. \"Defending the country that's trying to kick my family out is a thought that always runs through my mind.\" Gonzalez, who works on helicopters that bring cargo, supplies and military personnel in and out of Iraq, testified before a House Judiciary Committee panel last month, detailing his situation and urging officials to consider some sort of policy to deal with cases like his, where military members' families could be deported while they're defending their country overseas.\n\nWatch \"they're tearing families apart\" » . \"I want to serve my country 100 percent.\n\nBut with this issue in the back of my mind, I feel I can't do that,\" he testified on September 6.\n\nThe U.S. military does not have a policy to deal with such cases.\n\nEach is handled case-by-case, not by the military, but by immigration authorities.\n\nThe government doesn't have numbers on how many military members are in predicaments similar to Gonzalez's.\n\nImmigration officials also said marrying a U.S. citizen does not mean the spouse is automatically entitled to U.S. citizenship or permanent legal status.\n\nArmy Reserves who teaches immigration law at the U.S.\n\nMilitary Academy at West Point, New York, said she believes there should be an overall policy dealing with the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members. \"You got to understand.\n\nWhen you're in a combat zone, you need to be focusing all of your energies on fighting the enemy.\n\nYou can't be worried that your loved ones back home could be shipped off to a foreign country where you're never going to see them again,\" she said.\n\nStock also said the government is conflicted about how to treat such cases.\n\nOn the one hand, the government is supposed to be providing military families with assistance, housing and other forms of benefits while their spouses are overseas.\n\nOn the other hand, the same government is trying to deport the very same people. \"What's happening right now is, because of the dysfunction and complexity of our immigration laws, we've got people fighting overseas who are facing the impossible situation of having family members facing deportation back home,\" she said.\n\nIn Gonzalez's case, his wife, Mildred, came to the United States with her mother in 1989 when she was 5 years old.\n\nThey were granted political asylum because of their status as war refugees from Guatemala.\n\nIn September 2000, Mildred's mother applied for legalization and included her daughter in that application.\n\nHer mother was granted legal status in July 2004, according to Gonzalez.\n\nHowever, six weeks earlier, Gonzalez and Mildred got married, canceling Mildred's ability to apply for legal status through her mother because she was no longer an unmarried daughter under the age of 21.\n\nAs a result, her legal status still remains in jeopardy.\n\nA judge in June granted her a one-year extension to remain in the United States.\n\nIf her legal status does not change by June 8, 2008, she will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the country or face deportation.\n\nThat's just fine, according to Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which lobbies for tougher laws on illegal immigration. \"What you're talking about is amnesty for illegal immigrants who have a relative in the armed forces, and that's just outrageous,\" he said. \"What we're talking about here is letting lawbreakers get away with their actions just because they have a relative in the military. ...\n\nThere's no justification for that kind of policy.\" Gonzalez said that type of response is unjustified. \"I'm trying to make his country better -- my country better -- and it should be her country too.\" Gonzalez himself entered the country legally, crossing the Mexican border with his family when he was about 10.\n\nHe joined the Navy as a so-called \"green-card sailor\" and became a U.S. citizen in July 2005.\n\nThe military does accept some immigrants who aren't U.S. citizens. \"I understand the laws have to be followed and guidelines and a system must be maintained, but on the other token, there are times when the situation is just out of their reach,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nHis wife, Mildred, added, \"We didn't come here to break the law.\n\nWe just want to feel safe and have a home just like everybody else.\" U.S.\n\nEmmanuel Woko, a member of the Army's 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division who faces his third tour in Iraq, understands just how Gonzalez and his family feel.\n\nHis wife and children could be sent back to Nigeria. \"My heart is bleeding on the thought that my wife could be deported back to Nigeria while I am deployed in Iraq,\" he said. \"I am extremely distressed and distracted by the thought.\" That's a sentiment echoed by Gonzalez: \"We are not asking for anything.\n\nWe are just asking for our families to stay with us.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "text": "UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The United Nations is calling on NATO to do more to stop the Afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates Afghanistan's economy.\n\nAfghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Taliban-controlled Helmand province in April 2007.\n\nThe report from the U.N.'s Office on Drugs and Crime shows the export value of this year's poppy harvest stood at around $4 billion, a 29 per cent increase over 2006.\n\nDespite Afghan security forces' efforts to curb the trade, 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007, the report said.\n\nOpium is derived from poppies, and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground.\n\nThe report said opium has accounted for more than half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product in 2007.\n\nInvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a calendar year.\n\nAccording to the U.N. survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers.\n\nThe rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade.\n\nAntonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N.\n\nOffice on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001. \"Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,\" Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. \"Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source.\" James Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade. \"We share the U.N.'s concerns,\" Appathurai told CNN. \"Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation.\" He said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly. \"The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government,\" Appathurai said.\n\nFarming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said.\n\nHowever, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked.\n\nAccording to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes.\n\nCosta said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region.\n\nHe called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors. \"Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,\" the U.N. drug chief said.\n\nAppathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on.\n\nHe also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production. \"You cannot have eradication in isolation.\n\nIf we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future,\" he said.",

    "title": "NEW: John Edwards calls for immediate withdrawal of 40,000-50,000 troops .",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Democratic presidential candidates on Wednesday criticized President Bush's plan to withdraw roughly 30,000 troops from Iraq by next summer, with Sen.\n\nHillary Clinton labeling it \"too little, too late.\" Sen.\n\nDavid Petraeus testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nIn an open letter to Bush, Clinton said the troop withdrawal \"is simply too little, too late, and unacceptable to this Congress, and to the American people who have made clear their strong desire to bring our troops home, and end this war.\" Bush on Thursday is expected to endorse the recommendations of Gen.\n\nDavid Petraeus that the troop levels in Iraq be lowered to 130,000 by July, down from the \"surge\" level of 160,000. \"As commander in chief, you have the authority and ability to greatly accelerate the redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq, and to bring so many more troops home so much faster,\" the New York Democrat said. \"I strongly urge you to choose this course of action.\" In an interview Wednesday with CNN, one of Clinton's chief rivals for the 2008 nomination, Sen.\n\nBarack Obama of Illinois, said the president is returning to an earlier, failed policy. \"We now are still in the same position as we essentially were in June 2006,\" he said. \"We are in the same levels of violence; we are at the same levels of dysfunctional when it comes to the government in Iraq, and the American people at some point have a right to ask from their leadership in Washington and from the president: When is enough enough?\" Watch '08 Dems weigh in on war in Iraq » .\n\nObama presented a new plan for Iraq on Wednesday afternoon in Clinton, Iowa.\n\nIt calls for an immediate drawdown of combat operations at a pace of one or two brigades every month, to be completed by the end of next year, according to excerpts released before his speech.\n\nA brigade comprises between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers.\n\nObama recommended a new constitutional convention for Iraq, a new regional diplomatic effort and steps to confront the country's humanitarian crisis. \"Let me be clear: There is no military solution in Iraq, and there never was.\n\nThe best way to protect our security and to pressure Iraq's leaders to resolve their civil war is to immediately begin to remove our combat troops,\" Obama said in his speech.\n\nPresidential candidate John Edwards, who has been pressing congressional Democrats to take a more confrontational stance against President Bush, called for an immediate withdrawal of 40,000 to 50,000 troops.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Edwards, a Democrat from North Carolina, said Obama, Clinton and Republican Sen.\n\nJohn Warner of Virginia, who recently called for a withdrawal to begin by Christmas, have \"a moral responsibility to use every tool available to them, including a filibuster, to force the president to change course.\" Edwards also called Obama's plan for troop withdrawal a copy of the president's plan . \"Sen.\n\nObama would withdraw only one to two combat brigades a month between now and the end of next year,\" said Edwards, \"which for the next several months could essentially mimic the president's own plans to withdraw 30,000 troops by next summer.\" In a statement, Sen.\n\nChristopher Dodd, D-Connecticut, said Wednesday that it was useless to debate tactics when \"the underlying policy is a complete failure.\" \"I call on my colleagues to do what needs to be done to end our involvement in this civil war and help restore our national security by clearly and directly declaring that they will not support any Iraq measure without a firm, enforceable deadline tied to funding for the completion of redeployment of troops from Iraq,\" Dodd said.\n\nDemocrats lack the votes in Congress to force the president to bring the troops home and are seeking a compromise position.\n\nCongressional Democratic leaders are meeting with Republican lawmakers, who want a change in war policy but are unwilling to cut funding or set a timeline for withdrawal.\n\nPrivately, congressional Democrats concede that the next president probably will inherit at least a deployment of 100,000 troops in Iraq.\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidates, particularly the five in Congress, face pressure from liberal groups such as MoveOn.org demanding that they directly confront the president.\n\nObama said it was unlikely he would vote for any legislation that does not include a definite withdrawal deadline. \"You know, we are going to have to evaluate what's available, but it appears clear to me that the president is not willing to compromise, short of Congress forcing him to accept a shorter timetable, and, absent that, we are essentially engaging in a bunch of symbolic action there,\" Obama told CNN. \"What we need is a clear message from the Congress that it is time for us to change course, and it's time for us to do that,\" he said.\n\nCNN's John King, Dana Bash, Scott Anderson and Xuan Thai contributed to this report.",

    "title": "\"Inspiring Impressionism\" looks at Old Masters, other influences on modern art .",
    "text": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- It is an irony of contemporary art-museum management: Sometimes the museum that creates an exhibition doesn't get to premiere it.\n\nIn a treatment of a Bridgeman Art Library photo, the High shows visitors Jules Arnout's \"View of the Grand Gallery.\" This is the case this week, as Atlanta's High Museum of Art couples its public opening of a second year of Louvre-fueled shows from Paris, France, with an exhibition about influences on the Impressionists. \"Inspiring Impressionism\" is organized by the Denver Art Museum.\n\nIt opened Tuesday at the High, to run there through January 2008.\n\nWith the backing of Northern Trust, the show will then travel to Denver February 23 to May 25, 2008, and then on to the Seattle Art Museum from June 19 to September 21, 2008.\n\nThat museum this fall is host to pieces seen in the first year of the three-year Louvre Atlanta series of exhibitions.\n\nLike priceless dominos falling, these shows roll around the country and the world, globalization dictating galas, super-sensitive custom shipping companies probably among the biggest winners.\n\nSee a gallery of images from 'Inspiring Impressionism' at the High Museum of Art » .\n\nAnother unintended effect may be shadowing of one important outing by another.\n\nIt should be interesting to learn whether showing \"Inspiring Impressionism\" at the High on the same time frame as the second year of Louvre Atlanta pays off.\n\nDo all the boats in Monet's \"Autumn on the Seine, Argenteuil\" float?\n\nSmart museum-goers will see it all. \"The Louvre and the Ancient World\" and the companion show \"The Eye of Josephine,\" after all, look at some of the oldest treasures in the Louvre's vast holdings.\n\nSee a gallery of some of the highlights of the Louvre Atlanta shows » .\n\nThe fit is comfortable, in a way, the Impressionist movement of the turn of the last century finding its main proponents in French artists.\n\nThe emphasis here, however, is on what older works may have moved and motivated such artists as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul Cézanne.\n\nOne very distinctive connection from the Louvre Atlanta opener of last year is a section of this new show that looks at the tradition of modern-era artists learning by studying the work of masters at the Louvre, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo's \"The Beggar Boy\" of around 1650 being one of the most-copied canvases in Western art's modern history.\n\nFrom the outset, visitors to \"Inspiring Impressionism\" are reminded of the Louvre treasures all around them at the High: The Impressionism show's entry gallery is flanked by a handsome photographic treatment of Louis Jules Arnout's \"View of the Grand Gallery at the Louvre\" from between 1850 and 1870.\n\nIn that original painting and color lithograph that followed, Arnout captured the bustle of artists working and visitors promenading in the Louvre's chief exhibition space that runs along the Seine in Paris.\n\nIn fact, even older-era echoes of this same concept are encountered on looking at Louvre Atlanta's \"The Tiber\" marble from the first century A.D., you're reminded that Michelangelo himself was aware of that piece, influenced by it, presumably inspired by it.\n\nSo a surprise symmetry takes shape at the High this fall, as visitors contemplate dialogues between museums (the Louvre, the High, Denver, Seattle), the viewers of art in Europe and the United States, and the artists themselves in France, in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nHigh director Michael Shapiro calls these synchronicities \"visual evidence of connections.\" His colleagues Timothy Standring of Denver and Ann Dumas of London, England, have held up their end of this conversational eyeful with timely contributions, glimpses of Old World craft from Titian and Velasquez to Fragonard and Rubens -- and the \"moderns\" who saw beyond them to a new age of aesthetic debate.\n\nDon't miss some of the comments and writings of various artists, used as part of the display of the show at the High.\n\nDegas may have said it most honestly: \"No art is less spontaneous than mine.\n\nWhat I do is the result of refection and the study of the Old Masters.\" Joining Northern trust Corporation in funding the exhibition are the National Endowment for the Humanities, and support is also provided by an indemnity from the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities.",

    "text": "(CNN) -- Federal Emergency Management Agency officials know the agency's performance in the California wildfires will be watched closely for comparisons to its failures in Hurricane Katrina.\n\nA volunteer distributes donated food and supplies to evacueesTuesday at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium.\n\nFEMA Director David Paulison promised on Tuesday \"a different type of response than the federal government put together for Katrina.\" Paulison said Katrina \"was a wake-up call\" and that \"this is a new FEMA.\" President Bush signed a federal disaster declaration Wednesday, freeing up federal funds for families affected by the wildfires in seven counties in Southern California. \"I will continue to make sure that our efforts are coordinated, that we are responding to the needs of people, but most importantly I want the people in Southern California to know that Americans all across this land care deeply about them,\" he said.\n\nThe action follows an emergency declaration by Bush on Tuesday morning for the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura.\n\nHe said he's \"looking forward\" to his visit to the region on Thursday.\n\nAccording to a statement from the White House, the federal disaster declaration will allow for federal aid that \"can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.\" FEMA and other relief and rescue services face significantly different challenges in the fire zone than they did on the Gulf Coast in 2005.\n\nFor example, the fires aren't covering every square foot of the region, as Katrina did.\n\nThe devastation in California is intense but not universal.\n\nDuring and immediately after Katrina, the destruction was so complete that relief personnel and supplies -- even the U.S.\n\nArmy -- could not get within miles of the disaster's epicenter, New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward, for several days.\n\nBy contrast, roads in Southern California have remained open for residents to get out and help to get in without delay.\n\nResidents there are generally more affluent and are able to use their own vehicles to escape, whereas many of Katrina's victims were poor and had no means of transportation.\n\nVictims in California are not stranded on rooftops without food or drinkable water, but are able travel the relatively short distances to safe places.\n\nOne of those safe places is San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium, which is not endangered by the fires.\n\nFEMA and other relief agencies are able to stage supplies and meet victims' needs in an organized way.\n\nNew Orleans' Superdome, on the other hand, sitting in the center of the disaster zone, was severely damaged by hurricane winds and threatened by rising water.\n\nWhat had been a shelter devolved into a trap.\n\nKatrina also wiped out the Gulf Coast's communications infrastructure, crippling the coordination of relief efforts -- even for the military.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff acknowledged Tuesday that the government's response machinery had benefited from the Katrina experience. \"I think there's no question that [there were] a couple of the lessons from Katrina which we have put into effect here,\" Chertoff said. \"First of all, planning and preparation in advance for these kinds of challenges, so that we have worked together and planned together with the Defense Department and with state authorities well in advance of the crisis.\n\nThat's been a big help here,\" Chertoff said . \"Second, we have really flooded the zone as quickly as possible by staging assets to deal both with the firefighting issue and with the response issue,\" Chertoff said.\n\nChertoff said federal officials began discussing over the weekend the need to have FEMA ready, \"and as we saw the evacuation issue becoming more prominent, and the number of people seeking shelter becoming more prominent, we sprang into action yesterday. \"So we've been monitoring the situation continuously.\n\nAnd we're going to continue to stay ahead of this as far as we can.\" Chertoff said Tuesday that he hadn't waited for the paperwork to be signed before staging assistance. \"We have been moving cots, blankets, other supplies into the area of San Diego so that we can handle any necessity for additional sheltering capacity,\" he said. \"We've also moved air assets to be poised to take flight when we do have the opportunity to deal with the fire, once the winds begin to die down.\" People left homeless by the fires can already go online to apply for federal help at Paulison said.\n\nWatch Paulison discuss the \"new FEMA\" » .\n\nHe denied suggestions similar to those made in the aftermath of Katrina that the federal response was hampered because National Guard equipment was in short supply because of the Iraq War. \"I just haven't seen that,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. military has sent aircraft to help fight the fires, including 11 Defense Department helicopters equipped with water buckets and six C-130 aircraft able to drop water and flame retardant.\n\nMore than 17,000 National Guardsmen have been made available; 550 Marines were ready for deployment from Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego; and 12 Defense Department firefighting teams, were engaged.",

    "text": "(CNN) -- The late Chris Benoit idolized the Dynamite Kid, who was half of a professional wrestling team famous in the 1980s for spectacular high-flying, acrobatic moves.\n\nChris Benoit strangled his wife and suffocated his son before hanging himself in June.\n\nThe Dynamite Kid and his partner, Davey Boy Smith, were known as the British Bulldogs.\n\nThey were quick, agile and muscular, and in 1986 they won the World Wrestling Federation tag team championship.\n\nYoung Benoit dreamed of wrestling like the Dynamite Kid, whose real name is Tom Billington.\n\nAt the beginning of his career, Benoit adopted the Dynamite nickname and copied his idol's signature moves.\n\nIn June, Benoit murdered his wife and young son before hanging himself.\n\nInvestigators found testosterone, painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in Chris Benoit's body, Georgia's chief medical examiner said a month later.\n\nWhen asked about Benoit's double murder-suicide, Billington told CNN, \"It can make you aggressive, the steroids.\n\nBut personally I wouldn't, you know, kill no bleeding kid, or wife either.\" Billington now lives in a public housing apartment outside Manchester, England.\n\nBillington blames his wrestling life for doing this to him -- wrestling and the fact that he ignored doctors who told him to stop the punishment to his body.\n\nBillington told CNN that the steroids came from doctors, from friends, even from steroids meant for horses.\n\nHe took them all, took a terrible pounding in the ring, and like his partner (who died at age 39 in 2002), began taking extensive amounts of painkillers.\n\nBenoit's death has refocused a media spotlight on the organization for which he wrestled, now known as World Wrestling Entertainment, and the man who has ruled wrestling for years, Chairman of the Board Vince McMahon.\n\nMcMahon, appearing with Linda McMahon, his wife and WWE CEO, told CNN: \"Nothing from the WWE, under any set of circumstances had anything to do with Chris Benoit murdering his family.\n\nHow did we know Chris Benoit would turn into a monster.\" Read a full transcript of the McMahons interview .\n\nVince McMahon defended the organization, saying its drug-testing policy was not just for show. \"Our policy stacks up just as well as anyone else's in sport, although again emphasizing we are entertainment, and no one in entertainment, no one has this kind of wellness policy,\" McMahon said.\n\nCritics say McMahon pushes his stars and non-stars, works them too many nights per year and has encouraged the large physiques prevalent in modern wrestling.\n\nThey say McMahon only looks at his employees as commodities, pawns in a huge business.\n\nAbout 16 million people a week tune into WWE TV shows.\n\nTwo of their cable programs -- \"Raw\" and \"Friday Night Smackdown\" -- are weekly ratings giants.\n\nPay-per-view specials generate an average of $100 million per year.\n\nWhen asked about the high number of former wrestlers who had died before they turned 50 years old, Vince McMahon said each person in the WWE bore responsibility for their own lives -- especially outside the arena. \"If someone passes through our organization, it is not our responsibility for someone's personal activities,\" he said.\n\nHe also said there isn't \"any organization in the world, be it entertainment or be it sport, that can tell you that they are totally drug-free.\" Watch as a WWE wrestler says the perception of steroid use is wrong » .\n\nThe McMahons said the WWE is taking steps toward improving its oversight of its athletes.\n\nSince the newest WWE drug screening program began in February 2006, more than 30 of the organization's wrestlers have been suspended, including two since CNN's interview with the McMahons.\n\nDavid Black -- who helped the NFL develop its drug program and now runs tests for the WWE -- says twice that number have tested positive and been given a warning.\n\nGary Wadler, a world-renowned expert in the study of drugs and athletes, says the WWE is not doing enough. \"It certainly falls far, far short of where it needs to be,\" he said. \"And there is a gold standard, and

    "text": "(Mental Floss) -- Everyone goes through a rebellious phase.\n\nAnd, if you're lucky, you'll be able to look back on those years and laugh.\n\nIf you're less lucky, you spent those years on a reality show, so for the rest of time, millions of strangers can look back on them and laugh instead.\n\nIn modern times, cats frolic among the ruins of ancient Rome.\n\nYou could be responsible for the fall of Western Civilization, just like Justa Grata Honoria, the Roman princess whose wild ways and (literally) naked ambition set off a chain reaction that culminated in the destruction of the Roman Empire.\n\nSmart, conniving, and ruthless, Honoria possessed all the attributes befitting a Roman emperor, except for that pesky Y chromosome.\n\nAs a young girl, she watched as her dimwitted six-year-old brother, Valentinian III, was crowned emperor of the Western Roman Empire, while she was set aside to await a suitable marriage.\n\nHardly content to lead a quiet and chaste life, Honoria rebelled with aplomb, sleeping her way through the royal court while still in her teens.\n\nAlthough her after-hours habits caused quite the scandal, they failed to satiate her need for attention and power, so Honoria set her eyes on the throne.\n\nEmploying her ample charms, she seduced her brother's royal chamberlain, Eugenius, and together, they plotted to murder Valentinian and seize power.\n\nEugenius was executed, and Honoria was sent to a convent in Constantinople.\n\nLife as a nun was a fate worse than death for Honoria, but even that couldn't quell her ambition.\n\nShe spent her years at the nunnery plotting one escape attempt after another.\n\nFinally, out of sheer desperation, she turned to sources outside the empire.\n\nHer savior would have to be powerful enough to defy Valentinian and risk open war with Rome.\n\nOnly one man fit that description: Attila, king of the Huns.\n\nHonoria got the barbarian's attention with a mutually beneficial proposal: If Attila would rescue her, she would marry him, and he would get half of the Western Empire as her dowry.\n\nOf course, Honoria was in no position to rightfully offer any portion of the Roman Empire.\n\nBut she was betting that after marrying her, Attila would conquer the whole Empire, and she'd become queen to boot.\n\nAttila had secretly been planning a move against Rome for years, and Honoria's letter gave him the perfect opportunity to strike.\n\nWasting no time, he told Valentinian that he planned to marry Honoria, and demanded the dowry he'd been promised.\n\nNaturally, Valentinian refused, and Attila used his status as a \"wronged husband\" to invade Roman territory in 451 C.E.\n\nThe Hun armies quickly swept through the Empire, destroying everything in their path, and eventually they arrived in Rome.\n\nLike all the other cities before it, Rome would also have been annihilated were it not for the famine and disease that devastated the Huns during the invasion.\n\nRome survived Attila's assault with the unlikely help of another nomadic enemy tribe, the Visigoths, but the Western Empire never recovered.\n\nWithin a generation, the armies of the Goths, Franks, and Huns had overrun the area.\n\nUltimately, Honoria became neither Roman empress nor a Hun queen.\n\nAttila never rescued her, and she was eventually sent back to Rome and left to her brother's justice.\n\nNot wanting to cause a scandal by having her executed, and unwilling to send her back into exile where she could scheme again, Valentinian settled on a suitable third option.\n\nAfter years of struggle, Honoria finally suffered the fate she had been dreading all along: She was married off to an elderly Roman senator, and the rest of her life went unrecorded by history.\n\nEntire contents of this article copyright, Mental Floss LLC.",

    "text": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Football dignitaries gathered in Sheffield, northern England, on Wednesday to kick off the 150th birthday celebrations of Sheffield FC -- the sport's oldest club.\n\nFIFA chief Blatter was among those in Sheffield to kick off the 150th birthday celebrations of football's oldest club.\n\nGuests of honor at a service at Sheffield Cathedral included Sepp Blatter, president of football world governing body FIFA, and Massimo Moratti, president of Italian giants Inter Milan who are scheduled to play a friendly against Sheffield FC next month.\n\nOther guests attending a dinner in the club's honor included Real Madrid President Ramon Calderon and England and Manchester United legend Bobby Charlton.\n\nPele -- widely recognized as the greatest footballer ever to play the game -- is also due in town next month to attend Sheffield FC's clash with Inter.\n\nBlatter was unveiling a bust of the club's co-founder William Prest -- one of two cricket fans who founded Sheffield FC, then known simply as Sheffield Club, on October 24, 1857 after deciding they needed a new sport to keep them active during the winter.\n\nMany more football clubs soon sprung up and by 1862 there were said to be 15 in and around the Sheffield area.\n\nThe Football Association -- which codified the basic rules of the modern game -- was established in London the following year.\n\nSheffield FC was instrumental in developing set rules for the game.\n\nThe club studied existing rules and laid down a code of laws, which formed the foundation of the first commonly-accepted set of rules for the sport, according to the Sheffield FC Web site.\n\nThe team was also responsible for several innovations in the game -- including heading, which was unheard of until 1875, when Sheffield traveled to London for a game.\n\nAccording to the team's Web site, the sight of the Sheffield players using their foreheads in addition to their feet reduced the London crowd to hysterics.\n\nOther innovations attributed to the team include the solid crossbar on the goal, corner kicks, free kicks for fouls, and playing a match under floodlights.\n\nDespite its celebrated place in the history of the world's most popular sport, Sheffield FC has never played at a professional level.\n\nThe club currently competes in the Unibond League's First Division South, seven divisions beneath the English Premier League.\n\nThe city of Sheffield has two professional clubs -- United and Wednesday -- who both currently play in English football's second tier, the Coca-Cola Championship.\n\nSheffield FC's proudest achievement on the pitch came in 1904 when the team beat Ealing 3-1 to win the FA Amateur Cup in front of 6,000 people.\n\nBut 100 years later in 2004, Blatter presented Sheffield FC with FIFA's \"Order of Merit\" -- an honor previously awarded only to the nine-time European champions Real Madrid.",

    "title": "Polish diplomats brought pointed shoes to Britain in 1300s .",
    "text": "(RealSimple.com) -- Why shoes are called \"pumps\" and other strange-but-true stories behind the clothes and accessories you know and love.\n\nSo, how did the trend for pointed-toe shoes start?\n\nLong before they ever made an appearance on the TV show \"Sex and the City,\" pointed shoes were favored by Polish nobles, who introduced the fashion to England on a diplomatic visit in the 1300s.\n\nThe shoes, dubbed \"crackowes\" or \"poulaines\" -- after Kraków, Poland -- were so long that a chain running from the toe to the knee was often required to keep them from dragging.\n\nIn 1363 the English attempted to rein in the look by law, assigning shoe spans to social classes.\n\nCommoners could sport footwear with toes of up to six inches, while those in the royal ranks were allowed a full two feet in length.\n\nIn 1977 University of Vermont student Lisa Lindahl was running 30 miles a week -- and her bra wasn't holding up.\n\nWith the help of two classmates, Lindahl sewed together two jock straps and -- presto! -- the sports bra was born.\n\nThe coeds founded the company Jogbra a year later, garnering eternal gratitude from exercise-loving women everywhere.\n\nAlmost 40,000 sports bras are now sold annually.\n\nReal Simple: Best bras for every figure .\n\nIs there a real Mary Jane behind Mary Jane shoes?\n\nNot quite: The most widely held theory is that the single-strapped footwear was named for a character in \"Buster Brown,\" a children's comic strip that was popular in the early 1900s.\n\nMary Jane was either Buster Brown's sweetheart or sister, depending on which source you consult.\n\nGabardine, a water-repellent fabric invented by Burberry, got its first mention from Shakespeare.\n\nThe Bard used the word in The Merchant of Venice to refer to a coarse cloak worn as protection from storms.\n\nDuring World War I, British officers on the front lines kept warm and dry in a uniform coat made of the material -- the original Burberry trench.\n\nWho was the first person known to have pierced ears?\n\nNo one knows who originated the style, but there's evidence that as early as 2500 B.C.\n\nSumerian women wore pierced earrings -- gold half-moon hoops.\n\nAnd guys tired of defending their diamond studs can rest easy: Men have been wearing earrings since ancient Egypt, where the jewelry was introduced in 1500 B.C.\n\nReal Simple: Best way to clean jewelry .\n\nWhat was the inspiration for Lilly Pulitzer's colorful printed dresses?\n\nBored Palm Beach socialite Lilly Pulitzer opened a juice stand in 1959 to pass the time, but she found one drawback: The citrus concoctions discolored her clothes.\n\nShe instructed her dressmaker to create a uniform that would camouflage the bright stains, and the \"Lilly\" design -- sleeveless cotton shifts in vibrant prints -- was born.\n\nThe style was an instant hit with customers, who soon began placing more orders for dresses than juice.\n\nHow did pumps, stilettos, and sneakers get their names?\n\nThe term pump first popped up in 1550 in England, where male servants sported the style.\n\nIt is said that the noise they made while wearing the loose-fitting shoes resembled the sound of a water pump.\n\nThe word sneaker entered the language in the 1870s; the rubber soles made the shoes quiet and therefore \"sneaky.\" The modern usage of stiletto, a Renaissance-era Italian word for an assassin's narrow-bladed knife, made its debut in 1953.\n\nThe word turned out to be especially appropriate, because the shoes' pointy heels were murder on wooden floors.\n\nFor thousands of years, in such places as Egypt, China, Japan, Mesopotamia, and India, umbrellas were used exclusively to shade the heads of dignitaries from the broiling sun. (When it rained, the well-to-do stayed dry in covered carriages and sedan chairs.) Umbrellas weren't employed in inclement weather until the late 17th and early 18th centuries.\n\nAnd another hundred years passed before advances in manufacturing made them lightweight, portable, and available to average Joes.\n\nNamed for the nuclear-testing site Bikini Atoll, the suits first appeared in 1946, but American women thought them immodest.\n\nNot until the 1960s were they accepted, possibly helped by the hit song \"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini.\" Were French cuffs really created for the battlefield?\n\nIt is said that the cuffs were designed to be used as handkerchiefs in combat.\n\nBut, in fact, French royalty invented the style in the 1500s, when flowing sleeves were the rage; nobles would tie their sleeves back with fasteners.\n\nAmusingly, the competitive English tried to take credit for the fashion, which to this day they refer to only as \"double cuffs.\" Have women always carried purses?\n\nOnce upon a time, ladies stored their essentials in a little waist sack tied under their clothing (sort of an early ancestor of the fanny pack) and accessible through slits in their skirts.\n\nAround 1800, thinner, silkier fabrics and slimmer cuts came into vogue, and women could no longer hide the bulging sacks around their midsections.\n\nThey began carrying their belongings in small pocketbooks instead.\n\nIn the 16th century, drawers became a common term for both men's and women's underpants.\n\nMade of linen, the items were no-frills and looked more or less interchangeable (this being well before Victoria ever had a secret; decorative lace trim started appearing on the garments only in the middle of the 19th century).\n\nMost likely, underwear earned this distinctly unsexy epithet because it describes the way that people put on their unmentionables -- drawing them up and over the lower part of the body.\n\nReal Simple: Get your lingerie in order E-mail to a friend .\n\nGet a FREE TRIAL issue of Real Simple - CLICK HERE !",

    "title": "Thousands of teens attend Christian rallies each year .",
    "text": "(CNN) -- At one point in Jared Hutchins' young life, the Beatles were a big problem.\n\nThe rallies, which draw mostly teens, are one part concert, one part Christian revival. \"I had to stop listening to them for a while,\" said Hutchins, who lives in Cumming, Georgia, and plays the piano, guitar and harmonica.\n\nHe said the group's world view \"had a negative effect on me,\" and made him irritable and angry. \"God owns my life, not the Beatles,\" he said simply.\n\nAlthough Hutchins said he enjoys a wide range of music -- from Pink Floyd and Arcade Fire to Christian bands such as Hillsong United -- he said he has to be careful of what music he listens to, for the same reason he temporarily turned off the Beatles.\n\nHutchins, a 16-year-old graced with poise and thoughtfulness, is one of many teenagers who say that some part of popular culture, with its ubiquitous references to sex, drugs and violence, has harmed him.\n\nLast year, Hutchins and his Christian youth group attended an Acquire the Fire rally in Atlanta, Georgia, he said.\n\nAcquire the Fire -- regional rallies held across the country -- and BattleCry -- the larger rallies held this year in only three cities -- are the products of the evangelical Christian organization Teen Mania.\n\nGo behind-the-scenes with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a BattleCry event » .\n\nOne part concert, one part Christian revival, the rallies seek to \"stage a reverse revolution\" against secular popular culture.\n\nThey have the pull of headlining rock concerts, drawing thousands of people regardless of the region of the country, the month of year or the day of the week.\n\nThe audiences are nearly always predominantly teenagers and young adults.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2007, a total of 127,830 people attended the 34 Acquire the Fire rallies, and 71,414 people attended the three BattleCry events held in San Francisco, California; Detroit, Michigan; and Bristow, Virginia, according to Teen Mania.\n\nWatch flags, fireworks and teens at rally .\n\nFor Hutchins, who said he struggled in his early adolescence to fit in and be cool before having a personal experience with God about four years ago, the organization's message is exactly right. \"We don't have to be branded by the culture, we are branded by God,\" he said. \"Be who God created you to be.\" But the glossy, glamorous appeal of popular culture too often obscures that path to God, Teen Mania followers say.\n\nAnd so, Ron Luce, the 46-year-old founder of the organization, has waged a modern-day crusade against \"purveyors of popular culture,\" whom he has condemned as \"the enemy.\" More than two decades old, Teen Mania estimates it has reached more than 2 million teens with its message \"of living completely for Christ.\" The organization is sprawling.\n\nIn addition to its live stadium rallies, there are BattleCry shirts and hats, mobile screen savers, books and a television program.\n\nThere are international mission trips -- Hutchins attended one in Tijuana, Mexico, this summer.\n\nThere is even a Teen Mania internship, a one-year program called the Honor Academy, based in Lindale, Texas.\n\nIn the live events, Luce couples the earnest appeal of a young father with a preacher's ability to mobilize a crowd.\n\nHe weaves disturbing statistics about teenagers amid his gospel.\n\nToday's teenagers are in crisis, he says. \"We're fighting for those who don't know they have a voice, that are being manipulated by our pop culture indulging in things that, really, they're not mature enough to be thinking about yet,\" Luce told CNN. \"Kids are hurting,\" he said.\n\nAnd of those who he feels inflict these moral wounds, Luce said, \"We call them terrorists, virtue terrorists, that are destroying our kids.\" \"They're raping virgin teenage America on the sidewalk, and everybody's walking by and acting like everything's OK.\n\nAnd it's just not OK.\" To some, Luce's rhetoric is off-putting, hateful and divisive.\n\nOpponents point to his views on homosexuality -- not \"in God's plan\" -- and abortion -- the \"ending of a precious life\" -- and say Luce is imposing conservative values on vulnerable teenagers.\n\nIt is this criticism that Luce and his followers confronted head-on in March at BattleCry San Francisco.\n\nThere, in arguably the most liberal city in the United States, protesters, armed with megaphones and poster board signs, rallied against BattleCry on the steps of City Hall as the Christian teenagers circled and prayed in a demonstration of their own. \"Ron Luce is a liar!\" one protester shouted. \"Let me hear you say Christian fascist,\" another yelled.\n\nLuce and the youths, some as young as 11, also raised their voices. \"God, I ask that as we do this BattleCry, Lord, that you would reveal yourself to the teenagers, God, here, God,\" Mindy Peterson, shouted.\n\nPeterson is a member of Teen Mania's Honor Academy.\n\nAfterward, Peterson railed against what she said was the protesters' mischaracterization of BattleCry. \"These people think that our war is against other people.\n\nOur war's against ... the pain in teenagers' hearts, like depression, alcoholism.\n\nThose things that -- that are, like, tearing our teenagers apart,\" she said.\n\nWhile much milder in his terms, Hutchins agrees. \"We're a generation that is kind of troubled,\" he said.\n\nLuce wants to \"rescue the hearts of our generation,\" he added.\n\nAnd of the critics' contention that the rallies, the organization, the message is neo-conservatism wrapped in Biblical verse?\n\nHutchins smiles, nods patiently. \"I don't go because I have a political agenda,\" he said, adding that his friends don't, either. \"Mostly, what we're concerned with is Jesus.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nCNN's Christiane Amanpour, Julie O'Neill and Taylor Gandossy contributed to this report.",

    "text": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- I was 14 at the time.\n\nOne afternoon the shells began raining down on our neighborhood in Beirut.\n\nA Lebanese woman and her son run through west Beirut in 1989 during fighting between rival forces.\n\nOut of breath, my knees giving way, it seemed to take forever to reach our local shelter -- a dark humid room at the back of our apartment block.\n\nThe memory of that terrifying afternoon receded -- until recently.\n\nAfter more than a decade of relative peace and reconstruction, the bombings and assassinations have returned to Beirut.\n\nEvery time I hear of a new explosion, I think of a frightened child sitting in darkness.\n\nIn 1988, I watched the last throes of Lebanon's civil war firsthand -- and like millions of Lebanese, sad, frustrated and often fearful.\n\nSee a timeline of Lebanon's recent history » .\n\nNow I watch from another continent, but I find those same emotions resurfacing.\n\nThe conspiracies, the car bombs, the threatening rhetoric and political deadlock are eerily familiar.\n\nThe actors are like shadows from a long gone past.\n\nThey are grayer perhaps -- those who have avoided assassination.\n\nBut the cast in Lebanon's tragedy has changed little in two decades.\n\nThen, as now, a presidential election is the setting, and the struggle where religion and clan play the main roles threatens to set Lebanon back 20 years.\n\nIn 1988, the president's term was coming to an end and the warring factions were unable to agree on a new candidate.\n\nMilitias prevented parliament members from reaching the assembly building.\n\nThe West had abandoned Lebanon to the manipulation of its neighbors.\n\nSyria had its choice for president; Israel had its own allies -- a foil for growing Muslim radicalism.\n\nIn his last act as president, Amin Gemayel named fellow Christian and Army Chief Michel Aoun as prime minister.\n\nAt a stroke, he shattered the convention that a Muslim hold that position.\n\nMuslims refused to serve in the Cabinet and the country ended up with two governments.\n\nAoun famously declared: \"I am prime minister and six ministers in one.\" Aoun's \"War of Liberation\" against Syria turned into defeat.\n\nThen, he turned on fellow Christians of the Lebanese Forces in the \"War of Elimination.\" When that failed, the Syrians drove Aoun to take refuge at the French Embassy.\n\nIn August 1990, I came to CNN as a World Report panelist.\n\nI tried to explain Lebanon's chaos, the bewildering array of factions and the horrors of civil war for ordinary civilians.\n\nI had seen people killed in front of me; children orphaned in seconds, parents burying their infants in oversize white coffins.\n\nSo when I was offered the opportunity to stay at CNN, I gratefully accepted the chance to escape the anarchy.\n\nBut almost as I left, the civil war was being laid to rest.\n\nThe various factions had fought each other to a standstill; Arab governments, supported by the West, helped negotiate a new constitutional framework overseen by Syrian influence.\n\nPeace came to Lebanon, but it would be five years before I returned.\n\nI kept looking around for checkpoints manned by militants.\n\nI couldn't believe that I could go anywhere without being harassed or kidnapped by one faction or another.\n\nNo longer did identity -- Christian, Muslim or Druze -- define where Lebanese could go.\n\nPeople mixed freely in chic coffee shops and smoked the hubble-bubble, laughing at the same jokes.\n\nIt was as if Lebanon's divisions had been wiped away by some magic eraser.\n\nDowntown Beirut, once rocked by explosions and pitted with bullet holes, was rocking to Lebanese pop music.\n\nThe dusty sandbags had given way to boutiques carrying the latest European fashions and deluxe hotels.\n\nLovers had returned to Beirut's Corniche, overlooking the Mediterranean, for romantic strolls at sunset.\n\nBut the agreement that ended the civil war was more a truce than a real settlement -- and was overseen by a \"pax Syriana.\" As anti-Syrian sentiment grew, so did political tensions.\n\nOn Valentine's Day 2005, the Corniche was once again rocked by an explosion.\n\nOn the day of love, Lebanon was thrown back into its most hateful history.\n\nIt had been widely expected that Hariri would run for office again and demand the withdrawal of Syrian troops.\n\nSuspicion fell on Damascus, which vehemently denied involvement.\n\nOn March 14, Martyrs' Square became a human sea of demonstrators: Muslims, Druze and Christians alike, demanding the \"truth.\" But Hariri's death also exposed the fault lines that had broken Lebanon a generation previously.\n\nEven after it withdrew its troops, Syria still had allies in Lebanon.\n\nOne was Hezbollah, accused of the suicide attacks that had killed scores of U.S.\n\nMarines in Beirut more than 20 years previously.\n\nMichel Aoun; now back from exile, the same Michel Aoun who had defied Syria in 1989, but who now made common cause with Hezbollah against his fellow Christians.\n\nThe spirit of the Cedar Revolution had evaporated.\n\nAnti-government Hezbollah squatters had brought life there to a standstill.\n\nAs I passed through, business owners stood silent in the sun and shook their heads at me in despair.\n\nI wondered if they sensed my disappointment, my pain at watching Beirut bleed again.\n\nLebanon's political actors now find themselves re-enacting scenes from the final act of the civil war 19 years ago.\n\nOnce again, the term of the president is approaching its end; there is no agreement on his successor.\n\nSuspicion and fear are the political currency of the day.\n\nAnd the questions haunts me: Will the country's brief renaissance that so amazed me in 1995 be snuffed out by the old curse of sectarian rivalries?\n\nCNN's Joe Sterling, David Ariosto, Saad Abedine and Tracy Doueiry contributed to this report.",

    "text": "SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- Firefighters in Southern California are facing wind-whipped walls of flame from 15 wildfires that have scorched more than 400,000 acres and forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes.\n\nFirefighters battle the Witch fire Tuesday in the Del Dios area of Escondido, California.\n\nThe blazes have killed one person and injured at least 70 more.\n\nFirefighters were aided by resources from Mexico, the state and federal governments and even inmates from California's prisons.\n\nSan Diego Fire Department Battalion Chief Bruce Cartelli described scenes of \"utter devastation\" with hundreds of homes lost and \"many hundreds\" of others damaged. \"It's probably the worst significant event in my career of 36 years,\" he said. \"It will not end ... until it reaches the ocean or the winds turn around,\" Cartelli said.\n\nMeteorologists suggested that Santa Ana winds, which have fueled the wildfires with some gusts approaching 100 mph, could die down Wednesday afternoon. \"We are still facing some very serious fires,\" Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said after an aerial tour of the affected area. \"The weather has made it very difficult for the air assets to get up and fight the fires. ...\n\nIf the weather cooperates, maybe we can turn the tide tomorrow.\" Officials have evacuated nearly 350,000 homes in San Diego County alone, where the worst of the fires are blazing.\n\nCensus Bureau numbers from the 2000 census, that could mean as many as 950,000 were affected by the fires.\n\nIn San Diego County, at least half a million residents had been ordered to find refuge in shelters, schools and stadiums as fires pushed into new areas.\n\nAmong the evacuees as more than 4,000 military personnel from several bases in the area.\n\nWith the winds pushing them across the area, the fires spread quickly, forcing some residents to flee in the middle of the night. \"My wife woke me up like 12 o'clock, screaming and yelling that the flames were coming down,\" said Johnny Villanueva of Spring Valley, who fled with his wife and daughter to San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium, which is serving as a shelter to more than 12,000 evacuees. \"We just loaded up the car really quick and came down here ... slept in our vehicles.\" His wife, Elizabeth, added, \"I saw on the mountain on fire, and said, 'Oh my God, my family. ...\n\nLet's go.\" With Qualcomm Stadium being used by the evacuees, the San Diego Chargers planned to practice at the Arizona Cardinals' stadium in Glendale for next weekend's game.\n\nLake Arrowhead resident Michelle Dresser, who owns a business and was chased from her home by a wildfire last year, said she was waiting until the last minute to leave.\n\nShe spent the night in her store, partly to help customers and neighbors. \"It is crazy.\n\nWe are surrounded by fire on both sides,\" she said.\n\nAsked by CNN where she would go, she replied, \"I have to find someplace to accept two dogs, two cats and a turtle.\" Watch people staying with pets at refuge » .\n\nAnimals are allowed in Qualcomm Stadium, a nearby field and Del Mar Fairgrounds and Racetrack.\n\nPresident Bush is scheduled to visit the area on Thursday, the White House said.\n\nChertoff arrived in San Diego Tuesday afternoon for a \"first-hand look\" at the devastation. \"I wanted to see for myself, first of all, how the shelter situation is in San Diego, what the fires look like up close,\" Chertoff told CNN.\n\nThe secretary said that the federal response to the wildfires is \"phenomenally better\" than the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, \"because we have been preparing and planning and training together for the last 2 ½ years.\" \"Unlike in Katrina ... we have now built the process ... and we've rehearsed it, so when we take the field, the team already knows what we need to do,\" he said.\n\nAnd the scene at Qualcomm Stadium on Tuesday did seem to live up to Chertoff's expectations as volunteers cheerily handed out chairs, food and water.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger said he was \"heartbroken\" after touring the Lake Arrowhead area, where the Grass Valley and Slide fires have burned 5,000 acres and destroyed more than 200 homes. \"This is a tragedy, what is happening in California,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe combination of dry terrain, searing heat and hammering winds had created \"the perfect storm for fire,\" the governor said.\n\nSchwarzenegger said about 7,000 firefighters were battling the blazes, including 2,300 inmates from California's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\n\nSan Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders said the mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, had sent four fire engines and their crews to help out, and the governor of Baja California had offered help.\n\nChertoff said cots, blankets, water and other supplies have been moved where they are needed, and more are coming.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency delivered 25,000 cots to Qualcomm early Tuesday.\n\nAt least 150 National Guard members are assigned to provide security at the stadium.\n\nOf San Diego County's 10 major fires, the Witch fire in the north, which has grown to 200,000 acres, is the priority because of its significant threat to structures, said Ron Lane, the county's director of emergency services.\n\nThe Harris fire had burned more than 70,000 acres by mid-morning.\n\nIn northern Los Angeles County, the Ranch, Buckweed, and Magic fires have charred more than 93,000 acres and fire officials fear they could merge. \"We want to keep these fires as small as we can,\" said Capt.\n\nBarry Parker of the Ventura County Fire Department.\n\nThe 54,500-acre Ranch fire was only two miles away from the 1,200-acre Magic fire.\n\nThe blazes are straddling the L.A.-Ventura County line.\n\nAsked if he had enough resources, Parker said, \"We truly don't.\" \"We're using a limited amount of resources to go in and fight these fires,\" he said. \"We've got about 600 people on the Ranch fire; we normally would have about 1,500. \"So we have to be absolutely surgical in how we plan and how we tactically use our fire equipment because we just simply don't have enough fire engines in the state of California to battle these blazes.\" In San Diego County, a utility spokesman said a 500,000-volt transmission line was damaged when the Harris fire expanded, and it will be out of service until at least Wednesday.\n\nSanders said Mexico's Federal Electrical Commission was providing power to the area's grid to help make up for the losses.\n\nCalifornia also received extensive offers of manpower and equipment from the military.\n\nA total of 550 Marines were ready for deployment from Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego, and 67 Defense Department employees -- 12 firefighting teams -- already were engaged.\n\nEleven Defense Department helicopters equipped with water buckets and more than 17,000 National Guardsmen were available, along with six C-130 aircraft able to drop water and flame retardant on the flames.\n\nBut aerial attacks on the fires have been limited by the fierce Santa Ana winds.\n\nThe Red Cross and other groups also were in the wings.\n\nThey and some other groups were waiting for the flames to die down before bringing in their volunteers.\n\nThe Red Cross has set up 11 shelters in the area and housed 3,000 people Monday night.\n\nA firefighter at Rancho Bernardo in San Diego County showed distress. \"Every one of us out here feels like these homes are our own.\n\nWe know what it's like to see people's faces when they've lost everything.\n\nIt's devastating to see so much of this all at once.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nCNN's Thelma Gutierrez and Dan Simon contributed to this report.",

    "text": "(CNN) -- If you thought it was difficult managing your own money in 2007, consider the pressure of the task when you're dealing with $1.8 trillion of client assets.\n\nSallie Krawcheck has made Fortune's list of the World's Most Powerful Women every year since 2002 .\n\nThat's what Sallie Krawcheck does as Chairman and Chief Executive of Citi Global Wealth Management.\n\nShe joined the banking industry as a research analyst, but quickly rose through the ranks, gaining a reputation for honesty and integrity along the way.\n\nDubbed the \"Mrs Clean\" of Wall Street, Ms Krawcheck was credited with restoring investors' faith in analyst reports while head of retail brokerage firm Smith Barney.\n\nShe joined Citigroup in 2002, and spent some time as Chief Financial Officer before taking up her current role in March 2007.\n\nSallie Krawcheck has been a regular entrant on Fortune's list of the World's Most Powerful Women in Business -- in 2007, she made number 12.\n\nJohn Defterios caught up with Ms Krawcheck in Dubai.\n\nHe asked her for her views on the movement of capital outside the G8 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States).\n\nSallie Krawcheck (SK): I think what's happening right now, it's fascinating because in the United States and in developed Europe we're having a liquidity crunch -- someone might argue a liquidity crisis.\n\nAnd in fact, we are awash with liquidity in the Middle East and in Asia as well, so there's really a bifurcation that's occurring in the world.\n\nAnd if you think about, oil doesn't even have to stay at the 90-plus dollar level it is; even at levels in the 70's, 60's, 50's, 40's, a tremendous amount of liquidity is being generated in these markets which is really being put back into the market.\n\nYes, the investments are going up globally, but the governments here really are investing back in the infrastructure and the economies of this region.\n\nAnd so over time, you're really going to see...\n\nI think continue to see... a shift in economic activity on a relative basis from the more developed economies here to the Middle East as well as to Asia.\n\nJohn Defterios (JD): It's coming almost as a perfect storm; we have a sub prime crisis, a 20 percent fall in the dollar in the last two years.\n\nIn this window of time, is there a danger that the financial capitals build outside of Wall Street and it undermines its role? (SK): I think there is no doubt that New York is losing its status as a financial capital of the world.\n\nIf you think about some years ago, if you think about the internet bubble for example, where it was New York and California wasn't it?\n\nAnd you look at a whole range of reasons for it, and the sub prime crisis perhaps, the decline of the dollar perhaps.\n\nBut you have overlapping regulators in the United States, you have very high taxes in the United States, you have a very litigious environment in the United States, and you have the emerging markets coming up, so capital is being raised outside of the United States.\n\nThese things, some of which are negative for the United States, some of which are positive for the other regions, is accelerating a shift that was underway from New York, to London, to Hong Kong, to Singapore, and potentially to Dubai as well. (JD): Some of the wealth funds are now on the radar of both Wall Street and Capitol Hill in Washington.\n\nYou can't have your cake and eat it too.\n\nYou can't say I want some of that liquidity but I only want part of that liquidity.\n\nWhat is the result of that do you think?\n\nCan you over-regulate the sovereign funds? (SK): Oh, I think you can over-regulate the sovereign funds.\n\nI think the same question can be asked of the private equity funds and the hedge funds as well; where in a lot of countries the regulators have been struggling with the issue of 'here are very important drivers of global markets and global liquidity'.\n\nAnd the concern is if, gee these are going to be important going forward, we want to have these involved in our economy and our markets, but if we regulate this alone that money will skitter away to another market -- to a market outside the United States or Europe for example. (JD): It's fascinating because if you look at Qatar or Egypt or Shanghai, the stock markets have almost had like a one way path; there's been some correction here in the Middle East.\n\nBut what are we likely to see here, stair steps up the ladder with some corrections along the way, or an implosion because of the rapid gains? (SK): I think you've got to separate the idea of what's going on in the real economies and what's going on in the market places.\n\nThey move together, but sometimes they separate, they diverge, and they can diverge for a long period of time.\n\nIf you look at economic growth potential of the Middle East, of Asia, of Latin America, we feel very bullish about this.\n\nAnd I was making the point earlier today, China has been growing at 11 or 12 percent, not for one year or two years, but literally for 30 years.\n\nFor 30 years it's been growing at that kind of rate and really can continue as far as the eye can see.\n\nSo, say the same thing for the Middle East, the growth even at a lower oil price can be significant, but can be high single digit or double digit for some foreseeable period going forward. (JD): Is Wall Street, or for that matter, London or any other financial center ready for a woman -- for example in your case, 1.4 trillion dollars of assets... (SK): 1.8 Thank you... (JD): ...to run one of the major money center banks of the world?\n\nI'm sure you're feeling this pressure even though you're young by international standards.\n\nAre we ready for a woman to take over a money center bank? (SK): Well it looks like the United States may be ready for a woman to take over as President.\n\nSo I think if we're ready to potentially have a woman run the country, I think we are getting ready as a country, to potentially have a woman run a money center bank.\n\nNow, you know, the board wouldn't ask and I wouldn't accept, but if you look across Wall Street, there are a few women who are putting themselves in positions to be successors the next time there are CEO's who move along, and I think it's a very exciting development for the industry and for the country.",

    "text": "ORANGE COUNTY, California (CNN) -- One of the larger fires in Southern California was deliberately started by someone with apparent knowledge of arson, a fire official said Thursday.\n\nFirefighter Luke Perisin sets a backfire Wednesday against the Santiago Fire in Live Oak Canyon, California.\n\nThe Santiago Fire in Orange County was started in two places along a little-traveled road, according to Chief Chip Prather of the county's fire authority.\n\nThe fire, which has burned more than 25,000 acres, was started in brush just off Santiago Canyon Road, not close to homes.\n\nIt spread rapidly, indicating the arsonist had some knowledge of winds and other factors. \"It is a confirmed arson.\n\nThat is the purpose of our early declaration of it being an arson-caused fire,\" Prather said.\n\nWatch how the evidence points to arson » .\n\nPrather said officials originally thought the fire had three points of origin instead of two.\n\nThe Santiago Fire's points of origin are considered crime scenes, said Jim Amornino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.\n\nThe reward for information leading to an arrest has increased to $250,000 -- $50,000 each from the governor's office, the U.S. agency of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the FBI, Prather said.\n\nKFI radio has chipped in another $100,000, the sheriff's department said.\n\nThe state established a toll-free arson tip line at 800-540-7085.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger said anyone convicted of arson would be dealt with harshly.\n\nIf a suspect is to be found, \"it's going to be by a clue from the public,\" said county Sheriff Mike Corona.\n\nAbout 1,100 firefighters were working on controlling the Santiago Fire, which has destroyed at least 22 structures, according to Orange County Fire Battalion Chief Kris Concepcion.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the fire was only 30 percent contained Thursday morning after being 50 percent contained the day before.\n\nThe motive of the Santiago Fire's arsonist was a mystery to Concepcion. \"That's the part that I really can't figure out, to tell you the truth,\" he told CNN. \"That individual knew on Sunday when this fire started that we had, really, the perfect storm, if you will.\n\nWe had the heavy Santa Ana winds, we had the low relative humidities, we had the high temperatures. \"And then for someone to even think about doing something as reprehensible as starting a fire where they knew the fire would grow as rapidly as it would -- traveling about three, 3½ miles in about an hour -- is just really absolutely unconscionable,\" he said.\n\nThe smaller Rosa Fire in Riverside County, 100 percent contained at 411 acres Thursday morning, was also probably arson, state officials said.\n\nMeanwhile, Los Angeles Fire Department investigators are looking into whether a man who was arrested on suspicion of arson in the San Fernando Valley may have had a role in any of the ongoing blazes, an L.A. police spokeswoman said.\n\nCatalino Pineda, 41, was arrested Wednesday, Officer Kate Lopez told CNN.\n\nWitnesses told police they saw him lighting a fire on a hillside in the West Hills area of San Fernando -- northwest of Los Angeles -- then walking away, Lopez said.\n\nPineda was already on probation for \"making excessive false emergency reports\" to police at the time of the arrest, Lopez said.\n\nHis bail has been set at $75,000, she said.\n\nThe fire he allegedly set was brought under control, but now authorities want to find out if he had any role in the other wildfires.\n\nIn San Bernardino County, John Alfred Rund, 48, was arrested Tuesday evening and charged with setting a small fire along a rural roadside near Victorville.\n\nRund was to be arraigned Thursday morning in Victorville.\n\nHe was being held in lieu of $750,000 bail.\n\nThe county's district attorney's office on Thursday also filed arson charges against Anthony Riperti, 47, of Redlands.\n\nA statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire.\n\nHe is being held on $250,000 bail and will be arraigned later Thursday.\n\nThe San Diego County Sheriff's Department also arrested an adult and a juvenile accused by an anonymous tipster of starting a fire in Vista in the northern part of the county.\n\nIn a written statement, the sheriff's department identified the adult as Gorgonio Nava.\n\nThe Vista Fire Department extinguished the blaze before it grew out of control, the statement said.\n\nInvestigators have determined that the Grass Valley Fire in San Bernardino County was not caused by arson, and a preliminary investigation into the cause of the 10,152-acre Slide Fire seems to indicate arson was not a factor, sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Beaver said.",

ground against devastating Southern California wildfires.\n\nA plane drops fire retardant on the fourth day of a wildfire pushed by winds through Pauma Valley, California.\n\nWinds that gusted as much as 101 mph on Sunday dropped to about 30 mph Wednesday evening.\n\nMeanwhile, the dry Santa Ana winds that have fanned the flames, changed direction and began blowing inland from the Pacific Ocean, increasing the humidity and easing the burden on almost 8,900 firefighters in the area.\n\nBut the destruction was taking its toll on the men and women on the front lines of the fires. \"It hurts us to have those homes lost.\n\nAnd it is frustrating for us to watch our community be devastated by this,\" said firefighter Andy Menshek.\n\nAs conditions improved, officials allowed people to return to communities that had been off-limits because of intense flames and dense smoke. \"It was home,\" said Mark Davis, whose two-story Rancho Bernardo house burned to the ground. \"It was us.\n\nWe had been there 28 years, and it had a lot of our flavor.\" The change in the weather also meant that firefighting aircraft -- grounded for most of the week by the winds -- could finally fly.\n\nCalifornia

    "title": "CNN Medical Unit assignment manager Ann Curley is a type I diabetic .",
    "text": "Editor's note: Ann Curley is the assignment manager for the CNN Medical News unit.\n\nShe has been a type I diabetic for 40 years.\n\nThis is her story of life with diabetes.\n\nAnn Curley uses a pump attached to a catheter in her body to monitor glucose levels and administer insulin. (CNN) -- When I was 7 years old, my mom took me to the doctor because I had lost a lot of weight, despite a voracious appetite.\n\nMy family had just moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to Pasadena, California, and this visit to the doctor's office was my introduction to a man who would come to have a huge impact on my life.\n\nRobert Deputy, and he was the pediatrician who diagnosed me with diabetes.\n\nHe spoke to me directly, rather than to my mother, and he asked me questions: Did I feel thirsty?\n\nHe asked for a urine sample and the result was immediate.\n\nDeputy told me and my mother that my body wasn't processing sugar properly.\n\nThat is how my 40-year journey with diabetes began.\n\nI was checked into a hospital to learn how to test my urine for sugar, give myself injections of insulin, follow a diabetic diet and control my diabetes.\n\nI spent several days in the hospital learning how to manage my disease, and then they sent me home.\n\nDeputy would call our house each afternoon to check on me and see how I was doing.\n\nMuch to my parents' chagrin -- and to my delight -- he wanted me to be self sufficient and responsible for monitoring myself.\n\nI refused to let my parents give me injections or test my urine.\n\nThis demand for self sufficiency turned out to be one of my best life lessons, and not just for managing my diabetes.\n\nWhile some diabetics may feel their disease is a burden, I feel that being diagnosed with diabetes was a blessing in disguise.\n\nIt forced our family to eat healthily, and it taught me about good nutrition -- something I practice every day.\n\nI know carbohydrate counts in most foods, and I understand dietary concepts that most people don't even care about.\n\nBeing active is also a way to burn off high blood sugar, so when my urine tested positive for glucose, my older sister Robin was in charge of exercising me.\n\nWe had countless jump-rope contests, bike rides and roller-skating excursions, keeping me and my three sisters active and fit.\n\nAnd I felt like a little mad scientist, using a test tube with drops of water, urine and fizzy tablets to see if there was sugar in my urine.\n\nFirst, test strips were developed that could be dipped in urine to reveal whether sugar was present in it.\n\nBut the truth is, testing urine for sugar was a primitive method.\n\nBy the time sugar gets into the urine, it's a signal that the body doesn't have enough insulin to process sugar.\n\nAnd the urine test didn't give an actual number for the amount of sugar in the urine.\n\nIt simply gave a color reading that corresponded with a range of how much sugar was present in the urine.\n\nInaccurate was really an understatement when you talk about urine testing.\n\nHome blood glucose testing kits became available in the early 1980s, and they were a huge move toward precise control and management of diabetes.\n\nWith the kit, the diabetic uses a device to poke a finger and produce a drop of blood.\n\nThe blood is placed on a test strip that fits into a device that produces a reading of the blood glucose within seconds.\n\nWhile I initially balked at the idea of pricking my finger several times a day, now I can't imagine not doing it in order to monitor what my blood sugar is doing.\n\nThe 1980s also saw the advent of the insulin pump.\n\nThis device is the size of a pager and contains a reservoir filled with insulin.\n\nThe reservoir connects to a tube that infuses the insulin into the body with a tiny plastic shunt.\n\nSo rather than taking multiple injections to mimic the body's insulin patterns, the pump drips insulin into the body to keep blood sugars constant, then gives extra amounts with meals.\n\nAnother life-altering development in diabetes, which I have discovered in the last year, is the continuous glucose monitor, or CGM.\n\nThis is a small device inserted into the tissue -- usually the abdomen, hip or leg -- and it has a tiny sensor that reads the glucose level of the body's fluids.\n\nThe data is transmitted to a receiver, and patients can see a constant reading of their blood sugar levels.\n\nI have participated in clinical trials for three different CGM devices, and I found them all to be quite accurate.\n\nSome sensors transmit data directly to an insulin pump, so you can use the reading to adjust and fine-tune the amount of insulin being pumped into the body.\n\nThe patient still has to test his or her blood sugar to confirm the sensor is properly calibrated, but it's amazing to be able to see constant readings and graphs of what your blood sugar is doing and better manage blood sugars.\n\nCGM technology is a step toward the ultimate goal of controlling type I diabetes using what's called a \"closed loop system.\" This means diabetics someday will be able to wear a pump that gathers data from a sensor so precise that the pump can be programmed to act on its own and make adjustments all by itself.\n\nThe current systems are \"open looped,\" meaning the diabetic controls when the doses are given.\n\nThe goal is to eventually create a pump that is more like a robotic delivery system, and all the patient has to do is wear it.\n\nOnce that technology is perfected, this type of device would be implanted, which would be the next best thing to not having diabetes.\n\nI mentioned to my sister Robin that I had tracked down Dr.\n\nShe told me something I didn't know when I was 7.\n\nForty years ago, before the advent of all of the cool diabetes technology such as insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors and blood sugar testing, parents were given a fairly grim prediction for how their child would fare.\n\nDeputy told my parents that I would probably only live to the age of 20 or 30, which apparently -- but not surprisingly -- had the whole family freaked out.\n\nDeputy, who recently retired from his pediatric practice, and he seemed to remember me.\n\nWhen I asked him about his dismal prognosis for my survival, he said sadly, \"At that time, that was what we told parents back then. ...\n\nEverything changes with time -- diabetes, leukemia -- technology has changed with the pump and the equipment.\" I think he was relieved that his prognosis was wrong.\n\nIn fact, I am hoping to live another 40 years!",

    "title": "Obama holding concerts to win over African-American Christians in S. Carolina .",
    "text": "Barack Obama kicked off a series of local outreach gospel concerts Friday in Charleston, South Carolina, that unexpectedly came back to bite his campaign.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama is competing for the black vote with Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe concerts were meant to boost black voters' support for his presidential nominee bid -- the kind of events that would normally fly under the national radar.\n\nThe ensuing controversy highlighted that Obama's desire to unite disparate voting blocs -- especially religious voters -- under his umbrella of \"change\" is not without some serious pitfalls.\n\nWhen the campaign announced the lineups for the three-city \"Embrace the Change!\" gospel tour last week, one name stood out to gay bloggers: Donnie McClurkin.\n\nThe Grammy-award winning singer is on record as saying homosexuality is a choice, and that he was \"once involved with those desires and those thoughts\" but was able to get past them through prayer.\n\nTo say the least, neither of those arguments is very popular in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nJohn Aravosis, a prominent gay blogger and co-founder of the Web site AmericaBlog, led the charge against the Obama campaign, writing that the Illinois Democrat was \"sucking up to anti-gay bigots\" and \"giving them a stage.\" When the story bubbled up into the mainstream media, it took the Obama campaign by surprise.\n\nObama's efforts in the Palmetto State have overwhelmingly targeted African-American churchgoers in a bid to win over black voters in South Carolina from rival Sen.\n\nThe campaign has vigorously promoted the candidate's faith, launching \"40 Days of Faith and Family\" in September, which used Bible study groups to tap into the black electorate.\n\nCampaigners have run three radio ads, one of which called Obama a \"Christian family man,\" that aired on gospel stations across the state.\n\nEarlier this month, Obama spoke at an evangelical church in the traditionally conservative city of Greenville, where he demonstrated a casual familiarity with Christian vocabulary, telling the crowd, to much applause, that \"I am confident that we can create a kingdom right here on Earth.\" After that appearance, the Obama campaign told CNN that Republicans no longer had a choke hold on issues of faith and values. \"I think that what you're seeing is a breaking down of the sharp divisions that existed maybe during the '90s,\" Obama said. \"At least in politics, the perception was that the Democrats were fearful of talking about faith, and on the other hand you had the Republicans who had a particular brand of faith that oftentimes seemed intolerant or pushed people away.\" But on Tuesday, Obama was forced to confront the uncomfortable truth that some Christians and gays are a little more than just strange bedfellows, especially among blacks.\n\nObama issued a statement saying, \"I strongly disagree with Reverend [Donnie] McClurkin's views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the United States,\" and argued that it is important to confront homophobia among religious African Americans.\n\nA September poll of African Americans in South Carolina by Winthrop University and ETV showed that 62 percent of those surveyed said that \"sex between two adults of the same sex\" is \"strongly unacceptable.\" Obama held a conference call Wednesday with Joe Solomonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, and announced that the Rev.\n\nAndy Sidden, an openly gay South Carolina pastor, will appear at the same event as McClurkin on Sunday in Columbia.\n\nSolomonese was not completely assuaged. \"I spoke with Senator Barack Obama today and expressed to him our community's disappointment for his decision to continue to remain associated with Reverend McClurkin, an anti-gay preacher who states the need to 'break the curse of homosexuality,'\" he said in a statement. \"There is no gospel in Donnie McClurkin's message for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people and their allies.\n\nThat's a message that certainly doesn't belong on any presidential candidate's stage.\" The State newspaper in Columbia reported Friday that Obama organized a conference call Thursday night with gay and lesbian leaders.\n\nAfter the call, the South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Pride Movement announced it will hold a protest vigil outside Sunday's concert in Columbia.\n\nPrivately, Obama aides say they believe Obama is a candidate of real, transformational change, and that uproars like the McClurkin controversy are necessary speed bumps on the road to bringing people with opposing viewpoints together to air their differences.\n\nWill Obama's refusal to kick McClurkin off the concert bill hurt him?\n\nLike many political squabbles, despite the national story, it depends how much the controversy resonates with voters in those crucial early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nAnd in South Carolina, where African Americans make up about half of Democratic primary-goers, voters might not have a problem with McClurkin at all.",

    "text": "SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- Favorable weather and firefighter reinforcements helped ease the fire danger in parts of Southern California Thursday, but the human toll from the disaster was still coming to light.\n\nFour bodies were found in a canyon in the path of the blaze Thursday.\n\nThe number of deaths attributed directly to the fires grew to seven Thursday, after the charred bodies of four people believed to be illegal immigrants were found in a canyon east of San Diego.\n\nSeven other deaths are labeled as fire-related: Three elderly people died during evacuations, and four others died after being evacuated.\n\nImproving conditions allowed more people to come home Thursday, but new evacuations were ordered in areas where the unrelenting flames marched on.\n\nWhere residents could return, they often found ash and rubble in place of their homes. \"We see pictures from online and on TV, but it's just, it's much different when you see it up front,\" said Louela Binlac in front of what remained of her Rancho Bernardo home. \"The most important thing is that our family is still together, everybody is safe, and eventually we will rebuild again,\" she said. \"Those things you can replace.\n\nWe are just all grateful that everybody is safe.\" Rancho Bernardo resident Marilyn Wood said it was \"really scary\" to come back to the pile of ashes she once

of San Diego County's lucrative avocado crop, along with other croplands, greenhouses and nurseries.\n\nA change in the winds -- from a ferocious 100 mph on Sunday to an almost manageable 10 mph on Thursday -- brought welcome relief and allowed a full-bore aerial assault on the fires.\n\nReinforcements from across the country arrived to aid the exhausted firefighters, officials said.\n\nWhile the fires still threatened some 25,000 homes, the burn rate in the region -- a measure made up of factors like wind speed, humidity and available fuel -- was significantly lower Thursday, a spokeswoman at the California Department of Forestry and Protection said.\n\nResidents of several communities, including the city of San Diego, were allowed to return home Wednesday and Thursday, but more evacuations were ordered -- the latest covering the communities of Lake Henshaw and Mesa Grande and the La Jolla Indian Reservation in San Diego County.\n\nWith the shifting fires, some shelters closed as others opened closer to danger.\n\nIn San Diego, Mayor Jerry Sanders announced that Qualcomm Stadium -- the home of NFL's Chargers that held 11,000 evacuees at the height of the fires but dropped to 750 Wednesday night -- would close to evacuees. \"As we transition from a large-scale emergency evacuation center into the recovery process, we have begun assisting all evacuees to find more suitable shelter and housing,\" Sanders said. \"Toward that end, Qualcomm will close as an emergency shelter at noon tomorrow [Friday].\" Meanwhile, arson investigations were under way in Orange

doing something as reprehensible as starting a fire, where they knew that the fire would grow as rapidly as it would, traveling about three, 3½ miles in about an hour, is just, is really absolutely unconscionable,\" Orange County Battalion Chief Kris Concepcion said on CNN's \"American Morning.\" The FBI and the ATF are assisting Orange County authorities with the investigation.\n\nIn addition, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection considers the Rosa fire in Riverside County an arson case.\n\nThat fire burned more than 400 acres before being fully contained.\n\nIn other

    "text": "(CNN) -- If someone had asked Kelly Pless to describe herself three years ago, the word \"fit\" would have never crossed her mind.\n\nKelly Pless weighed 220 pounds at her heaviest.\n\nShe lost 95 pounds through diet and exercise.\n\nFor most of her adult life, the 31-year-old graduate student from Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, has struggled with her weight.\n\nShe started gaining as a teenager and by the time she graduated from high school, she was carrying 215 pounds on her 5' 2\" frame.\n\nProm, she says, was a nightmare. \"I had to go to three different stores to buy a dress,\" Pless said. \"I had to buy the biggest, also the ugliest, prom dress the store had because it was the only one that would fit.\" After high school, she lost 50 pounds.\n\nBut because she hadn't done it in a healthy way, her weight crept back up to 220 pounds.\n\nAt 28, she started having trouble breathing and doctors told her the weight was to blame.\n\nShe reached her breaking point. \"I remember being heavy and feeling like being fit just wasn't something I could be,\" said Pless. \"I remember feeling like even if I tried, it wasn't something my body was capable of.\" Despite her doubts, Pless decided to do something.\n\nFortunately she didn't have to look far for inspiration.\n\nSee before and after weight loss photos from CNN.com I-Reporters » . \"My manager at the Kennedy Space Center ran marathons, and he was the same age as my father,\" she said.\n\nBecause her own father had diabetes and was in poor health, he seemed much older, she said.\n\nOver the next three to four months, she began walking, without any real goal or expectation.\n\nPless believed that if she just focused on eating less and moving more, everything would fall into place. \"At first, it was hard to start exercising because I was worried people would make fun of me,\" Pless said. \"But then I just told myself, if that's the worst that could happen ...\n\nI just got out there and didn't care.\" Eventually, she started to run or \"shuffle\" as she jokingly recalls.\n\nShe also adopted an \"eat to live\" philosophy and satisfied her cravings for sweets by eating lots of fruit. \"I changed how I felt about food and what it meant to me,\" said Pless, who occasionally indulges in a bite of birthday cake or a piece of chocolate. \"One of the first things I cut out was cakes and cookies.\n\nAfter a few months of cutting those things out, I focused more on portion control,\" said Pless. \"I pretty much eat when I'm hungry and don't eat when I'm not and really try to pay attention to when those times are.\n\nMake sure I'm not eating out of boredom or [at] social events, I try to make sure I'm not overeating, just because everyone else is.\" Kelly Pless shares her weight loss secrets » .\n\nPless pays close attention to societal pressure, which she believes is the reason many people overeat.\n\nRestaurant servings are about three times bigger than a normal portion size, she says.\n\nShe makes sure she doesn't overeat when dining out simply because the food is there. \"What's hard is to change how you feel about foods that you love or that aren't necessarily good for you, or actually change how you look at food.\n\nThat was the hardest part for me.\" Instead of giving in to the temptation or convenience of calorie-laden or fatty foods such as cheeseburgers from the drive-through, Pless asks herself, \"What do I really want to eat?\n\nOr, what does my body really want right now?\" All of the hard work and determination paid off.\n\nPless has lost 95 pounds and kept it off for 1½ years.\n\nAs a result, she says, she's healthier and more confident.\n\nShe's also set a new professional goal -- to pursue a doctorate in food and exercise psychology -- so she can help others who are battling obesity and eating disorders. \"[The] negative side to weight loss is that people treat people differently.\n\nBeing fat was a good filter -- I'm automatically treated better by people because I'm thinner.\n\nSociety is so hard on people who are overweight or obese,\" said Pless. \"Now, those people think I'm funnier or smarter.\" Pless runs about 40 miles a week while she trains for two marathons she plans to run this winter.\n\nThe first is in November in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the second is in Miami, Florida, in January.\n\nForty pounds ago, the first thing she wanted to do once she lost the weight was to have a tummy tuck to remove all of the loose skin.\n\nBut now, she said she can't imagine taking the break from running that recovering from surgery would require. \"Running has become a constant for me and does so much more for me than maintain my weight, which is now about 125 pounds,\" said Pless.\n\nIf her past is any indication of her future success, Pless will certainly cross the finish line.\n\nShare your story, tips and photos E-mail to a friend .",

    "title": "Singapore Airlines A380 superjumbo completes historic maiden flight .",
    "text": "(CNN) -- It was two years late and billions of dollars over budget, but this week the Singapore Airline-owned A380 completed its maiden passenger journey between Singapore and Sydney.\n\nMaking history: the first double bed on a commercial jet .\n\nOn board were nearly 500 passengers who had bid thousands of dollars for the historical experience.\n\nThis was a turning point in aviation history as Airbus' superjumbo became the world's largest aircraft.\n\nAnd the time had finally come for it to receive some admiration.\n\nSingapore Airlines' CEO, Chew Choon Seng named the jetliner the \"queen of the skies\".\n\nTom Enders, CEO of Airbus said he would like to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary on one of its double beds.\n\nAnd CNN's Richard Quest, who was on board the maiden flight, said there was \"nothing quite like it\".\n\nThe luxury on board, he said, sets a new standard for air travel.\n\nIt's the quietest large passenger jet ever built (inside and out), it has a low fuel-burn to reduce fuel use and emissions, it can carry 40 percent more passengers than other large aircraft and in greater comfort.\n\nBut the feature that has attracted greatest interest on the Singapore Airlines A380 is its ''beyond first class\" cabins.\n\nBehind the sliding doors of the Singapore Airlines Suites, the well-heeled can luxuriate in a private cabin designed by leading French yacht designer, Jean-Jacques Coste.\n\nThere's a wide leather seat and alongside that, a standalone bed.\n\nThis is two meters long with Givenchy duvets and cushions.\n\nAnd for couples traveling, the beds on the middle two suites can be converted into double beds.\n\nFrom bed or chair, travelers can catch a movie on a 23-inch widescreen LCD.\n\nLaptops can be plugged into an in-seat power supply and business travelers with just a thumb drive can plug this into a USB ports and access a suite of office tools on Singapore Airlines' in-flight entertainment system.\n\nCelebrity chefs including Britain's Gordon Ramsay and Georges Blanc were behind the first class menu that can be eaten off Givenchy tableware.\n\nUnlike other airlines, that have considered offering casinos, gyms and showers on their future A380s, Singapore Airlines has opted instead for a configuration that, whilst offering luxury, also makes money.\n\nAs Chew Choon Seng, CEO of Singapore Airlines reminded reporters last week, the first Boeing 747s soon ditched the lounges and bars on the upper decks in favor of seats that could generate cash.\n\nBehind the 12 luxury suites there are 399 economy seats, ranked 10-abreast on the upper and lower decks, as well as 60 business class seats that are the biggest yet at 87 centimeters wide.\n\nSingapore Airlines has ordered 19 superjumbos for an estimated price tag of $5.7 billion.\n\nThe second is due to arrive next February with further deliveries later in 2008.\n\nTickets for the A380's first return commercial flight between Singapore and Sydney were sold at auction on eBay.\n\nOne passenger paid $100,000 for the experience, with the majority paying between $1,500 and $5,000.\n\nThe $1.4 million raised has gone to charities in Singapore, Sydney and a global humanitarian organization.\n\nFrom Sunday 28 October, Singapore Airlines will commence its scheduled service between Singapore and Sydney on one of the three daily flights in each direction.\n\nThe jetliner to be delivered next spring will be used on one of the three daily flights between Singapore and London's Heathrow Airport.\n\nIt's been a long road to this point for Airbus, but the journey is by no means over.\n\nThe airline has a tough delivery schedule ahead to fulfil its 185 orders to 15 customers (see figures below).\n\nNext year it plans to deliver 13, a further 25 in 2009 and 45 in 2010.\n\nTom Enders, Airbus' CEO doesn't underestimate the scale of challenge ahead. \"This is not a piece of cake,\" he told CNN, \"but we have learned our lessons and we are very confident today that we can deliver to our customers.\" It hasn't just been Airbus that has been frantically preparing for the A380 launch.\n\nAirports around the world have had to make changes to runways and gates, as well as buy in new vehicles that can tow the giant aircraft and lift high enough to its upper decks.\n\nSeventy airports are now ready, Airbus has said.\n\nSingapore's Changi Airport, home to the Singapore Airlines A380 fleet, was the first, and when its new Terminal 3 opens early next year, 19 gates across the three terminals will be A380-ready with aerobridge access to both decks.\n\nHeathrow's new Terminal 5 will be able to handle four A380s at one time.\n\nBritish Airways, the Terminal's sole occupant, recently confirmed an order for 12 superjumbos and it now wants BAA to upgrade a satellite building to be built next to Terminal 5 to accommodate them.\n\nAs Willie Walsh, BA's CEO told CNN, \"we want to make sure that development is built with the A380 in mind.\" But whether the arrival of the A380 sets a standard for future air travel is still undecided.\n\nAs CNN's Richard Quest points out, while these giant airplanes may be suitable for getting large numbers of people between key destinations quickly, demand could be even higher for the medium-size jets such as Boeing's up-coming 787 Dreamliner.\n\nAs Richard Quest says, \"there's no doubt the A380 will sell, but it is going to take a long time to reach the 420 sales which is the amount Airbus needs to make money.\" But those worries, he adds, are for another day.\n\nTotal: 185

    "title": "Saudi Arabia is the UK's largest trading partner in the Middle East .",
    "text": "(CNN) -- Behind the state banquet and smiles from Queen Elizabeth and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia's visit to London this week caused a wave of dissent.\n\nThe UK foreign secretary pulled out of a meeting with his Saudi counterpart to be with his new adopted son.\n\nAnd just days before he arrived, the Saudi King accused British officials of ignoring information that could have averted the terror attacks in London on July 2005.\n\nWhether the politics of the event were a success is open to debate.\n\nThe Saudis were also in town to cement a strong trading and business relationship that has developed between the two Kingdoms over the last 20 years.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the UK's largest trading partner in the Middle East.\n\nAnd behind the USA, the UK is the second largest foreign investor in the Kingdom.\n\nUK Trade & Investment has designated Saudi Arabia one of its 17 \"High Growth Markets\" along with UAE and Qatar in the region.\n\nAs the nation diversifies its economy away from oil, commercial opportunities for UK thrive in a variety of sectors.\n\nSaudi Arabia is currently planning six privately-developed economic cities.\n\nThe $26.6 billion King Abdullah Economic City -- the largest of these -- will create one million jobs and home to two million residents.\n\nThe aim, says the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority, is to boost the economy by creating a pro-business environment, and attracting investors and fostering investment opportunities.\n\nThe UK has, since the early 1990s, been one of the top five exporters to Saudi Arabia, behind USA, Germany, China and Japan.\n\nIn 2007, Saudi Arabian bank SABB predicts that UK exports to the Kingdom will increase by more than 5.5 per cent to reach $2.8 billion.\n\nWhile the balance of trade continues to be favor of the British, Saudi Arabia's exports to Britain are also gaining ground and closing the trade gap.\n\nThis year, exports to Britain are expected to reach a record high of $2.1 billion, says SABB.\n\nIn the 1980s, three quarters of Saudi exports to the UK were from oil, but today the non-oil sector accounts for 59 percent of exports.\n\nProducts being shipped to the UK include machinery, transport equipment, plastics, non-metallic minerals and, despite the UK's dominance in the sector, chemicals.\n\nAccording to SABB, there are also more than 150 Saudi-British joint ventures underway with a value of around $15 billion.\n\nAs John Sfakianakis, chief economist from SABB says, state visits such as this are important for bolstering trade talks, past and future. \"The biggest deal that will mark their relationship in trade is the purchase of 72 Eurofighter Typhoon Jets that was sealed last week,\" says Sfakianakis.\n\nThe contract between the Kingdom and the UK Ministry of Defence via BAE is worth over almost $10 billion for the aircraft alone and a further $19 billion for the deployment, maintenance and training.\n\nThis comes less than a year after the UK government decided to call off a Serious Fraud Office investigation into defense contracts with Saudi Arabia.\n\nThis probe related to the sale of weapons by BAE Systems to Saudi Arabia in the 1980s.\n\nBAE has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and making payments to Saudi royals to win business.\n\nBut as Sfakianakis points out, any political sensitivity surrounding the visit is unlikely to harm future trading relationships between the nations. \"The relationship is far deeper than that,\" he says. \"Saudi Arabia's economy is booming and the opportunities businessmen see here are immense.\n\nEverything else takes a subsidiary part in that.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "title": "Genarlow Wilson: Accepting plea deal would have left him without a home .",
    "text": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Genarlow Wilson, freed last week from a Georgia prison, said he's glad he rejected a plea deal from prosecutors, even if it would have sprung him from prison months earlier.\n\nGenarlow Wilson tells CNN on Sunday that he will be more conservative and alert in the future.\n\nThe 21-year-old, who served two years of a 10-year sentence for aggravated child molestation, said the prospect of being labeled a sex offender drove him to turn down the deal.\n\nHe had to think about his 9-year-old sister and having a family of his own one day, he said Sunday. \"It might've been lesser time, but then again, I would have nowhere to go because I would have no home,\" Wilson said during a CNN interview scheduled to air Monday at 8 p.m. \"I wouldn't be able to stay with my mother because I have a little sister.\n\nYou know, when you're a sex offender you can't be around kids.\n\nBasically, I can't even have kids myself, you know, so what is the point of life?\" he asked.\n\nIn 2005, a jury found Wilson guilty of aggravated child molestation for having oral sex with a 15-year-old girl at a 2003 New Year's Eve party.\n\nWatch Wilson say why he rejected the plea deal » .\n\nThe conviction carried a 10-year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation.\n\nAccording to Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker, prosecutors in Douglas County, Georgia, offered Wilson a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence, possibly to time served, and would have eventually removed the conviction and sex offender status from his record.\n\nBernstein said in June that Wilson rejected the deal because he didn't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence.\n\nThe state Legislature last year amended the law under which Wilson was convicted, making such sexual encounters misdemeanors.\n\nHowever, the Legislature did not make the law retroactive, so it had no effect on Wilson's sentence.\n\nNow 21, Wilson was released Friday after the state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that the young man's sentence \"constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\" Wilson said Sunday he feels no \"negative energy\" toward District Attorney David McDade, who fought efforts to have Wilson's sentence reduced.\n\nInstead, Wilson said, he is focused on the future and hopes to soon immerse himself in his college studies.\n\nHe wants to major in sociology, he said, \"because I feel like I've been living my major.\" The new Genarlow Wilson will be more conservative, more alert and more appreciative of the blessings bestowed upon him, he said. \"When it seems like you have everything, you know, you feel like you have no worries until it's all gone, and I know what it feels like to be without and I don't want to ever feel like that again,\" said the former honor student, football star and homecoming king. \"I don't ever want to see the inside of a prison or a prison, period.\" Though he called his sentence \"absurd,\" Wilson said he understands that prosecutors \"were doing their job and they felt they were carrying out the law.\" Wilson also said he knows what he did was foolish. \"I was young then.\n\nI did some idiotic things in my teen years, but you know, every average teen does,\" he said. \"I don't think any of us made very wise decisions, but I don't think that any of us can go back then and change what happened.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "title": "NEW: Feinstein, Schumer say they'll vote for attorney general nominee .",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The confirmation of Michael Mukasey as attorney general was all but assured Friday when two key Democratic senators said they will vote in favor of the nominee despite questions about his views on \"waterboarding\" and the president's power to order electronic surveillance.\n\nDianne Feinstein of California and Charles Schumer of New York announced they would support the retired federal judge from New York just hours after the chairman of the Judiciary Committee announced his opposition to the nominee.\n\nFeinstein and Schumer are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is scheduled to vote on the Mukasey nomination Tuesday.\n\nIf all the Republican members of the committee also vote for Mukasey, which is expected, his nomination will go before the full Senate.\n\nA leading Democrat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday Mukasey is likely to be confirmed if his nomination passes the Judiciary Committee.\n\nSchumer had praised the nomination of Mukasey as a consensus candidate when the president announced Mukasey as his choice to replace former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.\n\nGonzales gave up the post in September. \"This is an extremely difficult decision,\" Schumer said. \"When an administration so political, so out of touch with the realities of governing and so contemptuous of the rule of law is in charge, we are never left with an ideal choice.\n\nHowever, Judge Mukasey, whose integrity and independence is respected even by those who oppose him, is far better than anyone could expect from this administration.\" A number of Democratic senators, however, have said they will oppose Mukasey because of questions about his views on the interrogation technique called \"waterboarding\" and the president's power to order electronic surveillance.\n\nWaterboarding involves restraining a suspect and using water to produce the sensation of drowning.\n\nMukasey told senators this week that he finds waterboarding \"repugnant,\" but he could not answer whether the technique amounts to torture.\n\nWhile saying \"serious questions have been raised about Judge Mukasey's views on torture and on separation of powers,\" Feinstein said she would support the nominee because the Justice Department needed fresh leadership. \"First and foremost, Michael Mukasey is not Alberto Gonzales.\n\nRather, he has forged an independent life path as a practitioner of the law and a federal judge in the Southern District of New York. \"I believe that Judge Mukasey is the best we will get and voting him down would only perpetuate acting and recess appointments, allowing the administration to avoid the transparency that confirmation hearings provide and diminish effective oversight by Congress.\" Just hours before Feinstein and Schumer announced their decisions, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen.\n\nPatrick Leahy, D-Vermont, announced he would vote against the Mukasey nomination.\n\nLeahy explain why he can't support the Mukasey nomination » . \"No American should need a classified briefing to determine whether waterboarding is torture,\" Leahy said. \"Waterboarding was used at least as long ago as the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nWe prosecuted Japanese war criminals for waterboarding after World War II. \"I am eager to restore strong leadership and independence to the Department of Justice.\n\nI wish that I could support his nomination.\n\nAmerica needs to be certain and confident of the bedrock principle -- deeply embedded in our laws and our values -- that no one, not even the president, is above the law.\" President Bush demanded the Senate confirm Mukasey during a speech Thursday at the Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank. \"In a time of war, it's vital for the president to have a full national security team in place,\" the president said.\n\nThe president has equated asking Mukasey about his opinion of waterboarding with asking him about the CIA-run interrogation program, whose details are classified.\n\nBush said the program does not violate U.S. bans on torture, but added that Mukasey \"does not want an uninformed opinion to be taken by our professional interrogators in the field as placing them in legal jeopardy.\" But Leahy said \"Judge Mukasey was not asked to evaluate any secret 'facts and circumstances.' \" \"He was asked whether waterboarding is illegal.\n\nOur law makes torture illegal, and waterboarding is torture, and it is illegal.\n\nIt is frankly not dependent on any, quote, 'relevant facts and circumstances of the technique's past or proposed use,' \" he said, quoting from Mukasey's response to senators on the question.\n\nSources with knowledge of the CIA-run interrogation program have said agents are no longer using waterboarding.\n\nBut those sources have said waterboarding was used in the interrogation of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, now facing trial before a military tribunal for planning al Qaeda's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington.\n\nThe practice was used by the Spanish Inquisition, Cambodia's Khmer Rouge and the World War II Japanese military, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nIt is specifically banned in U.S. law governing the treatment of prisoners by the U.S. military.",

    "text": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Banksy is Britain's most wanted artist -- his art sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars, but he continues to use public spaces as his main canvas, while all the time keeping his identity a secret.\n\nBanksy's latest piece in East London where a passer-by claims to have taken a photo of the artist.\n\nThe guerilla artist has been spray painting his stencils around Britain and further afield for over ten years.\n\nLast week ten of his original pieces were sold at Bonham's auction house in London for over $1 million, while on the other side of the city Tower Hamlets council authority pledged to remove his graffiti from its streets.\n\nFrom his beginnings as a graffiti artist in Bristol, England, Banksy has become the darling of the art world for his subversive and satirical public art.\n\nDepicting things such as riot police with smiley acid-house faces and camera-wielding rats, his work is now sold now by major art galleries.\n\nLazarides Gallery in London is one of the main dealers of his work and describes him as \"a media star...but popular long before any of this high-profile activity -- simply because the people love his stuff.\" While he set out to lampoon the establishment, he has now been wholeheartedly embraced by it.\n\nFans include Hollywood A-listers, including Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Christina Aguilera who bought three of his prints in 2006, including one of Queen Victoria sitting on a woman's face.\n\nThe recent sales of his work put him on a par with Jean-Michel Basquiat as the best-selling street artist.\n\nHe is feted by art dealers and artists, including Damien Hirst, but he regularly mocks the art world that is so enthralled by him with ingenious stunts such as hanging his own work in the Tate gallery in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\n\nIt took the British Museum eight days to discover the \"prehistoric\" rock painting of a man with a shopping trolley in the British Museum Banksy has hung on a wall.\n\nThere is often a political message with this work, too.\n\nHe left an inflatable doll dressed as a Guantanamo prisoner in Disneyland and painted a hole with blue sky on the Palestinian side of the West Bank wall.\n\nDespite the huge popularity and exposure of his work, Banksy's identity remains a mystery.\n\nAs he operates on the fringes of the law with his guerilla art it makes sense, but also adds to his mystique.\n\nSome things are know: he's originally from Bristol, is around 30 years old and called Robert or Robin Banks, but it's been reported that even his parents are thought to believe that he makes his living as a painter and decorator.\n\nHe continues to divide opinion as to whether his work is vandalism or public art.\n\nVeteran British art critic Brian Sewell called Banksy, \"a complete clown, and what he does has absolutely nothing to do with art.\" Bristol city council has recognized the popularity and artistic merit of his work by protecting a number of pieces around the city.\n\nOther local authorities don't feel the same way.\n\nTower Hamlets and Hackney councils in London have pledged to remove his graffiti from their streets.\n\nHis latest work painted on a wall in East London -- a man in overalls resting next to a giant flower drawn as a continuation from the double yellow lines on the road -- is thought to be the artist's response.\n\nBut this latest piece may also have revealed what the artist actually looks like.\n\nA passer-by took a photo of what is thought to be the artist at work.\n\nA spokesperson for Banksy refused to confirm it was him, but did say it was definitely his work.",

    "title": "Rubbish is piling up on the streets of Naples, with municipal dumps full .",
    "text": "ROME, Italy (CNN) -- The garbage crisis in Naples encompasses the worst Italian clichés, and in particular those of the southern part of this lovely peninsula: mismanagement, political interference, mafia profiteering and the ability of those responsible to deflect the attention and the blame elsewhere.\n\nNaples has had problems in finding sites for municipal dumps -- now workers have stopped collecting trash.\n\nThere is a popular saying here that roughly goes like this: everybody is competent enough (to find a solution) but nobody is responsible (for actually carrying it out).\n\nIn many parts of the world waste disposal is a business -- and usually it is a good business.\n\nGarbage can be transformed into various sources of energy and then sold for a profit.\n\nIn Naples, garbage is also good business, but in the sense that millions, if not billions, of euros have been wasted -- and nobody really knows how.\n\nThe problem is as old and ugly as rotten trash.\n\nThe region's dumps reached full capacity more than a decade ago, and since then a state of emergency has been declared every year.\n\nEight different commissioners have been appointed, but they have all failed to solve the problem.\n\nState of emergency means government money: €1.8 billion (more than $2.5 billion) in emergency funds have been devolved to deal with the problem.\n\nIt is still difficult to find out where or how that money has been spent.\n\nIncinerators that were supposed to be built were never finished, either because the companies in charge of constructing them could not finish the job, or else because magistrates stopped the work, pending ongoing criminal investigations into alleged mafia involvement.\n\nOne Italian newspaper suggested that a good 20% of the money went to pay for the salaries of those in charge of coming up with a solution to the problem.\n\nMore worrying perhaps, is another suggestion: that the local mafia, known as the Camorra, is taking advantage of the situation.\n\nAs the crisis has worsened over the years, so the Camorra's profits, estimated now at around €1 billion (roughly $1.45 billion), are alleged to have increased.\n\nThe Naples prosecutor in charge of environmental crimes says city government officials use the state of emergency to quickly award contracts which otherwise would have to be checked by complicated anti-racketeering legislation.\n\nOnce they receive the money, companies linked to the underworld dispose of the waste either in the open or, ironically, at regular city dumps, even if they are overflowing.\n\nThe mafia clans have now managed to burrow their way so deeply into the system that every attempt to fix the problem has proved futile.\n\nWell, the government wants to re-open a previously shut dump to dispose of 3,700 tons of waste which is laying in the streets of Naples and surrounding areas.\n\nThe problem is that when the site was closed years ago, locals were promised that a golf course would be built there.\n\nAs a result, many residents invested savings to construct apartments and residences in the vicinity -- in some cases just a few yards away from the site.\n\nThey are now waking up to a mountain of trash instead of 18 holes.",

    "title": "Russia to send bomber aircraft on long-range flights on a permanent basis .",
    "text": "CHEBARKUL, Russia (Reuters) -- President Vladimir Putin said on Friday security threats had forced Russia to revive the Soviet-era practice of sending bomber aircraft on regular patrols beyond its borders.\n\nA Russian strategic bomber flies over an airfield outside Moscow during an air show.\n\nPutin said 14 strategic bombers had taken off simultaneously from airfields across Russia in the early hours of Friday on long-range missions. \"We have decided to restore flights by Russian strategic aviation on a permanent basis,\" Putin told reporters after inspecting joint military exercises with China and four Central Asian states in Russia's Ural mountains. \"Today, August 17 at 00:00 hours, 14 strategic bombers took to the air from seven airfields across the country, along with support and refueling aircraft ...\n\nFrom today such patrols will be carried out on a regular basis. \"We hope our partners will treat this with understanding.\" At U.S.\n\nBush's Texas ranch, White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said he did not believe the flights posed a threat to the United States. \"Militaries around the world engage in a variety of activities, so this is not entirely surprising,\" he said.\n\nBut the sorties are likely to add to Western concern about Russia's growing assertiveness.\n\nThat trend has prompted some U.S. policymakers to draw parallels with the Cold War.\n\nPutin caused a stir this year by saying Russian missiles would once again be aimed at targets in Europe if Washington persisted with plans to build a missile defense shield in eastern Europe.\n\nRussian diplomats have clashed with the United States and European governments on issues such as Kosovo, energy, and Moscow's treatment of its ex-Soviet neighbors.\n\nWestern military leaders have said this year that Russian flights near their airspace were becoming more frequent after a long quiet period.\n\nOne Western defense official called the flights \"a little bit of chest-pounding, trying to let people know Russia is back in the game\".\n\nPutin said that when Russia had cut its flights in 1992, other military powers had not reciprocated. \"Flights by other countries' strategic aircraft continue and this creates certain problems for ensuring the security of the Russian Federation,\" Putin said.\n\nThat appeared to be a swipe at the U.S. and NATO, whose strategic bombers have continued to fly long-range missions.\n\nAs Putin spoke to reporters and television cameras, four Russian military helicopters appeared and hovered in the background while Russian tanks trundled behind him, even though the exercises had ended long before.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Russian long-range bombers, which can carry strategic nuclear weapons, played elaborate games of cat-and-mouse with Western air forces.\n\nEarlier this month Russian air force generals said bomber crews had flown near the Pacific island of Guam, where the U.S. military has a base, and \"exchanged smiles\" with U.S. pilots scrambled to track them.\n\nThe Pentagon said the Russian aircraft had not come close enough to U.S. ships to prompt American aircraft to react.\n\nIn July, two Russian Tu-95 \"Bear\" bombers made unusually long sorties over the North Sea, leading Norway and Britain to scramble fighter jets to follow them.\n\nRussia's air force said later it was a routine flight.\n\nAll rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.",

    "text": "The Hamburger -- Louis' Lunch, New Haven, Connecticut .\n\nThis burger did not come from Louis' so ketchup is OK.\n\nThere are competing claims for the coveted \"Inventor of the Hamburger\" title, but according to Louis' Lunch (and the Library of Congress, for that matter), this small New Haven restaurant takes the prize.\n\nThe story goes something like this: One day in 1900, a rushed businessman asked owner Louis Lassen for something quick that he could eat on the run.\n\nLassen cooked up a beef patty, put it between some bread, and sent the man on his way.\n\nPretty modest beginnings for arguably the most popular sandwich of all-time, huh?\n\nIf you visit Louis' today, you'll find that not much has changed.\n\nThe Lassen family still owns and operates the restaurant, the burgers are still cooked in ancient gas stoves, and, just like then, there is absolutely no ketchup allowed. 2.\n\nThe Fried Twinkie -- The ChipShop, Brooklyn, New York .\n\nSometimes what counts isn't being the inventor, it's being the innovator.\n\nThe Twinkie -- in all its indestructible glory-- has been around for ages, but when ChipShop owner Christopher Sell had the brilliant idea to freeze the snack, dip it in batter, and deep-fry it, the Twinkie took gluttony to new heights.\n\nEven The New York Times raved about how \"something magical\" happens when you taste the deep-fried Twinkie's \"luscious vanilla flavor.\" Sell, who was trained in classical French cuisine, didn't start with the Twinkie, though.\n\nIn his native England, he fried up everything from M&M's to Mars bars. 3.\n\nRoot Beer Float -- Myers Avenue Red Soda Co., Cripple Creek, Colorado .\n\nIf you thought what happened up on Cripple Creek only happened in song, you're sorely mistaken.\n\nIn August of 1893, a failed gold-miner-turned-soda-company-owner named Frank J.\n\nWisner was drinking a bottle of his Myers Avenue Red root beer while looking up at Cow Mountain.\n\nJust then, a full moon illuminated the snowcap on the otherwise black mountain, and Wisner had a brilliant idea -- float a scoop of vanilla ice cream in a glass of his root beer.\n\nThe new drink was christened the \"black cow\" and became an instant classic.\n\nToday, of course, most of us call it a root beer float. 4.\n\nCorn Dogs -- Cozy Dog Drive In, Springfield, Illinois .\n\nIn 1946, Ed Waldmire, Jr., revolutionized the stick-meat world when he debuted the Cozy Dog -- the first corn dog on a stick.\n\nAt first, he wanted to call his creation the \"Crusty Cur,\" but his wife convinced him to change the name to \"Cozy Dog.\" She felt people wouldn't want to eat something described as \"crusty.\" Good call, Mrs.\n\nShortly after the Cozy Dog's inception, the Cozy Dog Drive In opened alongside old Route 66 and has been serving up corn dogs ever since. 5.\n\nThe Pizzeria -- Lombardi's, New York City, New York .\n\nPizza has existed in one form or another for a long time, but America got her first true pizzeria when Gennaro Lombardi opened up a small grocery store in New York City's Little Italy.\n\nAn employee named Anthony \"Totonno\" Pero started selling pizzas out of the back, and in no time, Lombardi's was concentrating on its burgeoning pizza business instead of plain old groceries.\n\nIn 1905, the establishment was licensed as a pizzeria, and it's stayed that way ever since.\n\nThe original restaurant closed in 1984 but reopened down the street 10 years later.\n\nOn its 100th anniversary in 2005, Lombardi's decided to offer its pizza for the same price it'd been sold for in 1905 -- 5 cents a pie.\n\nNeedless to say, the line wrapped around the block. 6.\n\nYou may not know what the Fat Darrell is, but when you hear what it contains, you'll understand why it's truly a work of inspired genius.\n\nSince 1979, Rutgers University has played host to a collection of mobile food vans collectively known as the \"Grease Trucks.\" Originally, they served a sandwich called the Fat Cat, which contained two cheeseburger patties, French fries, lettuce, tomato, and onions.\n\nThen one night in 1997, a hungry (and broke) student named Darrell W.\n\nButler convinced one of the vendors to put chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, French fries, and marinara sauce on a sandwich.\n\nStrangely, the concoction sounded so appetizing that the next 10 people in line ordered it, and the Fat Darrell became a mainstay at the Grease Trucks.\n\nHey, not any old sandwich gets to be named Maxim magazine's top \"Meat Hog\" sandwich. 7.\n\nPhilly Cheesesteak -- Pat's King Of Steaks, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania .\n\nPhiladelphia is known for many things (Ben Franklin, the Liberty Bell, and Rocky, for starters), but fine dining is not really its forte.\n\nThat's OK, though, because Philly is the home of Pat's King of Steaks, and Pat's King of Steaks is where the Philly cheesesteak was born.\n\nOne day back in 1932, hot dog stand owners Pasquale (Pat) and Harry Olivieri decided to change things up and make a steak sandwich with onions.\n\nA cab driver who ate at Pat's daily insisted on trying the new sandwich, and with the first bite declared, \"Hey, forget 'bout those hot dogs, you should sell these!\" Cab drivers know fast food about as well as anyone, so the brothers did just what the cabbie suggested.\n\nIn no time, the modest stand turned into the Pat's that exists today.\n\nControversy remains, however, over who's responsible for putting the cheese in cheesesteak.\n\nPat's claims it was the first to do so (in 1951), but across-the-street rival Joe Vento of Geno's Steaks (opened 1966) insists he added the finishing touches. 8.\n\nOnion Rings -- Pig Stand, Dallas, Texas .\n\nAccording to most sources, the onion ring was invented when a careless cook at a Pig Stand location in Dallas accidentally dropped an onion slice in some batter, then pulled it out and tossed it in the fryer for lack of a better destination.\n\nNow, you'd think inventing the onion ring would be enough for one restaurant chain, but not Pig Stand.\n\nThe company also lays claim to opening America's first drive-in, inventing Texas toast, and being one of the first restaurants to advertise using neon signs.\n\nNot bad for a little outfit from Texas. 9.\n\nDerby Pie -- Melrose Inn, Prospect, Kentucky .\n\nA Kentucky favorite, derby pie is a chocolate and pecan tart with a pastry-dough crust -- and that's about all we know about it.\n\nBecause the recipe is jealously guarded by the Kern family.\n\nMelrose Inn manager George Kern created derby pie in the mid-1950s with help from his parents, Walter and Leaudra, and the dessert was such a hit that the family was soon baking the treat full-time.\n\nKern, being the crafty monopolist she was, copyrighted the name, and to this day, you can only get real \"Derby-Pie®\" through Kern's Kitchen, Inc.\n\nNot only that, but a man from New England once handed Leaudra a blank check for the recipe so that his daughter could make the pie at home.\n\nEntire contents of this article copyright, Mental Floss LLC.",

    "text": "(CNN) -- The crew members of a North Korean freighter regained control of their ship from pirates who hijacked the vessel off Somalia, but not without a deadly fight, the U.S.\n\nWilliams ordered pirates to give up their weapons, the Navy says.\n\nWhen the battle aboard the Dai Hong Dan was over, two pirates were dead and five were captured, the Navy said.\n\nThree wounded crew members from the cargo ship were being treated aboard the guided-missile destroyer USS James E.\n\nThe captured pirates were being held aboard the North Korean vessel, the Navy said.\n\nThe bandits had seized the ship's bridge, while the crew kept control of the steering gear and engines, the Navy said.\n\nThe Koreans moved against the attackers after the Williams -- responding to reports of the hijacking -- ordered the pirates to give up their weapons, according to the Navy.\n\nWhen the crew members stormed the bridge, the deadly battle began.\n\nAfter the crew regained control, Navy sailors boarded the Dai Hong Dan to help with the injured.\n\nNorth Korea and the United States have no diplomatic relations.\n\nWatch why the U.S. helped the North Koreans » .\n\nThe incident took place about 70 miles northeast of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, the Navy said.\n\nIt is the second incident of piracy reported in recent days.\n\nNavy destroyer was searching waters off Somalia for pirates who hijacked a Japanese-owned ship, military officials said.\n\nOver the weekend, gunmen aboard two skiffs hijacked the Panamanian-flagged Golden Nori off the Socotra archipelago near the Horn of Africa, said Andrew Mwangura, a spokesman for the Kenyan-based Seafarers' Assistance Program.\n\nThe guided-missile destroyer USS Arleigh Burke has been pursuing the pirates after entering Somali waters with the permission of the troubled transitional government in Mogadishu, U.S. officials said Monday.\n\nIn recent years, warships have stayed outside the 12-mile limit when chasing pirates.\n\nTwo military officials familiar with the details confirmed the ongoing operation.\n\nThe Navy's pursuit of the pirates began Sunday night when the Golden Nori radioed for help.\n\nThe Burke's sister ship, the USS Porter, opened fire and sank the pirate skiffs tied to the Golden Nori's stern before the Burke took over shadowing the hijacked vessel.\n\nWhen the shots were fired, it was not known the ship was filled with highly flammable benzene.\n\nU.S. military officials indicate there is a great deal of concern about the cargo because it is so sensitive.\n\nBenzene, which U.S. authorities have declared a known human carcinogen, is used as a solvent and to make plastics and synthetic fabrics.\n\nFour other ships in the region remain in pirate hands, the Navy said.\n\nU.S. and NATO warships have been patrolling off the Horn of Africa for years in an effort to crack down on piracy off Somalia, where a U.N.-backed transitional government is struggling to restore order after 15 years of near-anarchy.\n\nOn Monday, the head of the transitional government resigned as his administration -- backed by Ethiopian troops -- battled insurgents from the Islamic movement that seized control of Mogadishu in 2006.\n\nHospital officials reported 30 dead in three days of clashes on the city's south side.\n\nIn June, the ship USS Carter Hall fired warning shots in an attempt to stop a hijacked Danish cargo ship off Somalia, but the American vessel turned away when the pirated ship entered Somali waters.\n\nNavy advisory warned merchant ships to stay at least 200 miles off the Somali coast.\n\nMaritime Administration said pirates sometimes issue false distress calls to lure ships closer to shore.\n\nThe pirates often are armed with automatic rifles and shoulder-fired rockets, according to a recent warning from the agency. \"To date, vessels that increase speed and take evasive maneuvers avoid boarding, while those that slow down are boarded, taken to the Somali coastline and released after successful ransom payment, often after protracted negotiations of as much as 11 weeks,\" the warning advised.\n\nThe agency issued a new warning to sailors in the Gulf of Aden, between Somalia and Yemen, after Sunday's hijacking.\n\nCNN correspondents Barbara Starr at the Pentagon and Christian Purefoy in Nairobi contributed to this report.",

    "text": "(CNN) -- Debra Lafave, the former Florida middle school teacher convicted of having sex with a student, violated her probation by hugging a young co-worker, a Florida judge found Thursday.\n\nDebra Lafave was arrested after talking with a teenager.\n\nShe is not allowed to have contact with anyone under 18.\n\nBut the judge did not send Lafave to jail, saying the violation was \"not willful and substantial.\" \"Please don't come back,\" he scolded.\n\nDressed in a tailored, black pantsuit, Lafave said she had \"innocent\" physical contact with a female co-worker she knew as under age 18.\n\nAt the time, she and the 17-year-old hostess worked at Danny Boy's, a small restaurant in the Tampa, Florida, area.\n\nLafave, 27, pleaded guilty in November 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old boy and was sentenced to three years under house arrest and seven years of probation.\n\nLafave was required to register as a sex offender and ordered not to have any contact with minors.\n\nA tracking device she carries as part of her probation went off in court, prompting the prosecutor to observe, \"I think she's accounted for.\" Lafave acknowledged she was aware that hugs and other forms of physical contact -- as well as conversations about sex -- with minors violated terms of her probation.\n\nShe referred to the sexually explicit conversations at work as just \"girl talk.\" Lafave denied talking about her sex life with co-workers. \"I don't speak that way about my personal life,\" she said.\n\nBut she added that her co-workers spoke freely about sex in a \"small group setting.\" While other co-workers socialized outside work, Lafave said, the 17-year-old was not included in those outings.\n\nAsked why she hugged the young co-worker, Lafave explained it was a small restaurant with a casual atmosphere where co-workers felt like family.\n\nThe contact came, she said, \"out of my good nature, that's the way it worked.\" The contacts that led to Thursday's probation violation hearing first surfaced during two polygraph tests administered as part of Lafave's court-ordered supervision.\n\nShe received a verbal reprimand a year ago, according to testimony.\n\nWhen the behavior continued, her probation officer asked a judge to find her in violation.\n\nShe was ordered to quit the restaurant job and now works as a receptionist in her mother's beauty shop.\n\nIn the past, Lafave has said she suffers from bipolar disorder and is receiving treatment.",

    "text": "It doesn't really matter all that much what hot, nubile French maverick has set the fashion world on fire.\n\nOr which Milanese visionary has a new fabric technique discovered during a life-changing trip to Angkor Wat that's sure to bring back sixties minimalism with a twist.\n\nOr that so-and-so has signed a deal to develop boutique spa hotels around the globe in former monasteries.\n\nBecause, in the end, he's Ralph Lauren, and we're not.\n\nRalph Lauren has his eye on China and Japan.\n\nFor four decades no other designer has had a greater impact, not only on the way American men and women dress but also on the way they imagine, seek and indulge in the Good Life, than the former tie salesman from the Bronx. \"Those ties were handmade, by the way,\" recalls Lauren. \"Back then, ties, even designer ones, didn't sell for more than $5 apiece.\n\nSuch luxury in something so simple was revolutionary.\" And ironic.\n\nBecause while no other designer logo exemplifies aspiration in the home of the free and the brave like the mallet-wielding guy on the pony, Lauren originally named his company Polo because \"it was the sport of kings.\n\nIt was glamorous, sexy and international.\" See his designs » .\n\nIn the beginning a few people questioned if it was named after Marco Polo -- but today the fact that virtually none of Lauren's millions of devoted customers has ever even seen a polo match is immaterial.\n\nLauren instinctively caught something that was in the air before any of his competitors had a chance to grab it -- the desire, not just to be a success but to look like one before you'd even achieved your goal.\n\nWhat's more, Lauren made it look as easy as Fred Astaire dancing down a staircase. \"What matters the most to me are clothes that are consistent and accessible,\" says the designer. \"When I look at the people I've admired over the years, the ultimate stars, like Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant and Astaire, the ones who last the longest are the ones whose style has a consistency, whose naturalness is part of their excitement.\n\nAnd when you think of the blur of all the brands that are out there, the ones you believe in and the ones you remember, like Chanel and Armani, are the ones that stand for something.\n\nFashion is about establishing an image that consumers can adapt to their own individuality.\n\nAnd it's an image that can change, that can evolve.\n\nIt doesn't reinvent itself every two years.\" However, with a media that is insatiable for the new, the now and the next, being steadfast doesn't always make for good copy. \"The spotlight is always going to search for the newcomer,\" Lauren admits. \"And that's fine.\n\nBut the key to longevity is to keep doing what you do better than anyone else.\n\nIt's about getting your message out to the consumer.\n\nIt's about getting their trust, but also getting them excited, again and again.\n\nMy clothes -- the clothes we make for the runway -- aren't concepts.\n\nThankfully, we have lots of them,\" says Lauren. \"What I rely on is people walking into my store saying, 'I want your clothes.'\" Well, if all of Lauren's customers shouted that together, he would go deaf faster than he could pull on one of his classic pullovers.\n\nLauren's effortless luxury is all over the red carpet, on ski slopes and boats, at Wimbledon and elsewhere.\n\nIt furnishes living rooms and graces dinner tables.\n\nIt's on the bed, in the bed and under the bed -- and now sits on coffee tables, thanks to the tome Ralph Lauren (Rizzoli), celebrating his 40-years-and-growing career.\n\nBut far from giving his customary over-the-head wave and riding off into his Colorado-ranch sunset, the designer is going even more global. \"Americans have a real inferiority about their own style.\n\nWe've brought sportswear to the world, and yet we have a long way to go.\" Already in Milan, London, Paris and Moscow, Lauren has more stores planned for China, Japan ... oh, everywhere. \"There aren't enough Americans out there,\" he says.\n\nJust as long as he doesn't let on that most of us still can't play a lick of polo.\n\nGet a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE!",

    "text": "(CNN) -- A man named as a suspect in the fatal shooting of a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, police officer last week was captured at a shelter in Miami, Florida, on Tuesday, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Sylvester Johnson said at a news conference.\n\nMiami Police Chief John Timoney said he had been alerted by Philadelphia police that the suspect, John Lewis, had taken a Miami-bound bus from Philadelphia.\n\nActing on information from Miami Rescue Mission, officers went to a homeless shelter where they found Lewis, \"who was pretty easy to spot as he's 6 feet, 270 pounds,\" Timoney said.\n\nHe was apprehended \"unarmed and without incident,\" the Miami chief said.\n\nTimoney said it didn't appear that anyone in Miami was helping Lewis, according to CNN affiliate WPVI.\n\nMiami Police Officer Gil Gonzalez said Lewis \"had a Bible and was praying when we went to get him.\n\nHe had a look of guilt, a look of shock.\" Philadelphia Mayor John F.\n\nStreet said people at the shelter recognized Lewis from televised photos of the suspect.\n\nLewis is suspected in the October 31 shooting of Philadelphia Police Officer Chuck Cassidy.\n\nCassidy was shot in the head when he inadvertently walked into a robbery in progress at a Dunkin' Donuts.\n\nInvestigators told WPVI that Lewis was spotted on security video boarding a bus to Miami on Saturday night.\n\nCassidy was one of three Philadelphia police officers shot in a four-day period last week.\n\nMariano Santiago was shot in the shoulder late last Tuesday as he approached a vehicle.\n\nOfficer Sandra VanHinkle was shot early last Sunday and is out of the hospital and doing well, police say.\n\nFormer co-workers of Lewis who spoke to WPVI said they were surprised by the allegations against him. \"He was so nice,\" Kiani Clark told the station. \"He was really nice.\n\nHe didn't seem like the type that would hurt a fly.\" The Associated Press reported that Lewis had been arrested in 2005 on drug charges, which were withdrawn after he completed a treatment program.\n\nHe was arrested again in June on drug charges, and that case is still pending, the AP reported.\n\nAll rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.",

    "title": "Tiburon is low-slung sportster that won't bust first-time buyer's wallet .",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES, California -- One of the bigger difficulties any first-time buyer faces is purchasing a car that doesn't scream \"first-time\" to friends, relatives and co-workers, or indeed to the buyer each time they step into an ill-chosen purchase.\n\nTo break from the boring econobox, here are some of the more sculpted and stylish cars available for about $20,000 that will hold their looks for a long time and give a little bit of joy to a first-time owner.\n\nIf you didn't know already, Tiburon means \"shark\" in Spanish, and it's not hard to see how Hyundai's sporty coupe can stalk the unwary first-time buyer and snare them quickly.\n\nLike an instantly recognizable dorsal fin, the Tiburon in its third incarnation is perhaps the purest low-slung sportster that won't bust a first-time buyer's wallet, though it may chew a hole in the seat of their pants as they're pushed back into those tight-hugging bucket seats.\n\nThe startling Hyundai-designed looks boast a touch of Italian styling uncommon for its bracket.\n\nA bona-fide pocket rocket, any first-time buyer can put a fair distance between themselves and the pack in the MazdaSpeed3, part of the Asian carmaker's strategy to wrestle performance compact coupe sales from European carmakers.\n\nThis one isn't overbearingly dripped in trim or wings, but don't let any youngster tell you it doesn't have what it takes to make their peers jealous.\n\nThe MazdaSpeed3 will storm from standing to a mile a minute in under six seconds and is said to hit 155 mph.\n\nIts secret is torque negation in the low gears -- and perhaps its 263 horses under the hood.\n\nAnother hidden gem is its seven-speaker Bose stereo.\n\nMuch like the fantastic Chevy Cobalt SS, its younger sister Pontiac G5 GT boasts highly sprung motoring at a price that appeals to the first-time buyer's wallet.\n\nThe G5 GT has been tweaked just slightly from its sister SS -- like the difference between Ashlee and Jessica Simpson -- boasting a less horizontal grille and more sculpted valance.\n\nBoth are reasonably stylish from the back and side and both leaving plenty room for aftermarket add-ons.\n\nA new grille entirely, like a Phantom, may just be what you need to set it off against the crowd.\n\nThe GT's inline-four 2.4-liter 173-hp engine -- 25hp over the base -- drives the front wheels to hit 0-60 mph in 7.5 seconds.\n\nGas mileage is good and customer satisfaction ratings are off the hook.\n\nA revamped chassis is the key to why Ford's Mustang has become an outstanding product at a price that's hard to beat.\n\nA tweak to the iconic lines for last year included a smaller back window and a longer, craggier front end.\n\nSome might of course call us heretics for picking a V6 over the famous eight-cylinder included in the GT package but, to be honest, the V6 performs admirably, pushes out 210hp and emits a low-down growl that sounds wonderful.\n\nA Civic hatch was my second car (after a very short-lived VW Rabbit).\n\nThe coupe tested earlier this year brought back fond memories of the Civic's surprisingly roomy front cabin, its enjoyable handling and maneuverability, first-class economy and its sporty elongated hood and swooping back end.\n\nStandard features include a 350-watt premium sound system, a touch-screen satellite-navigation system whose screen flips to reveal the CD player, and a slot for a computer memory card.\n\nIt's also got a funky dash that spectrally lights at night -- what fun.\n\nOn the heels of its 2004 release, Toyota's hipster Scion brand has remodeled its boxy wonder this year, this time boasting more than a design nod to its parent company's FJ Cruiser.\n\nWide rear pillars, wraparound headlights and bumper define the second-generation variant, which comes dripping with gadgetry inside, as well as leaving plenty of room for after-market customization.\n\nThis one turns heads while allowing you to pack five adults in relative comfort.\n\nOther notable features include a central console that fits in a DVD player alongside a backlit GPS sat-nav system that lights up in any one of 10 colors.\n\nA co-worker bought one of these after crashing her old and very badly beaten up Saturn on a left turn into oncoming traffic.\n\nSo it technically wasn't her first car, but for many buyers, it will be.\n\nEnergetic, filled with flair and boasting a vertical fold the length of its bonnet, the Fit looks the part as well as being colossally roomy inside for what you expect.\n\nYou don't get a third row of seats in there but, with the back row folded flat, it almost lends you to believe it can become a camper.\n\nOther great touches include an mp3 input jack and reclining rear-seat headrests, while gas mileage is, as expected, very good indeed.",

    "title": "Bush: Senate \"wasting valuable time\" with children's health insurance bill .",
    "text": "(CNN) -- President Bush blasted the Democratic-controlled Congress on Tuesday for having \"the worst record in 20 years.\" \"Congress is not getting its work done,\" Bush said, flanked by members of the Republican House leadership. \"The House of Representatives has wasted valuable time on a constant stream of investigations, and the Senate has wasted valuable time on an endless series of failed votes to pull our troops out of Iraq.\" Bush criticized Congress for not being able to send \"a single appropriations bill\" to him. \"They haven't seen a bill they could not solve without shoving a tax hike into it,\" he said.\n\nJim Manley, senior aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, said, \"Taking advice from President Bush about fiscal responsibility and getting things done for the American people is like taking hunting lessons from Dick Cheney.\n\nRahm Emanuel, D-Illinois, issued a statement saying, \"President Bush's rally this morning reminds us that congressional Republicans remain ready and willing to rubber-stamp the Bush agenda: No to children's health care; no to a new direction in Iraq; and no to investing in America's future.\n\nThe White House and congressional Republicans want to continue the status quo.\" Bush said the Senate was \"wasting valuable time\" by taking up the children's health insurance bill, which he had earlier vetoed.\n\nWatch Bush describe what he thinks Congress is doing wrong » .\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, issued a statement calling Bush \"the biggest obstacle\" to extending health coverage to \"10 million low-income, working-class American children.\" Hoyer said GOP House leaders need to \"stop posing for pictures, and sit down with Democrats and Republicans in Congress who are working together to extend coverage to our children.\" The State Children's Health Insurance Program measure passed in the House last week would expand the program by nearly $35 billion over five years, the same as the measure Bush vetoed on October 3.\n\nBush had proposed adding $5 billion to the program, and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded, state-run program.\n\nDemocratic leaders said the new version addresses Republican objections by tightening restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving SCHIP benefits; capping the income levels of families that qualify for the program; and preventing adults from receiving benefits.\n\nThe program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor, but who can't afford private insurance.\n\nDemocrats want to extend the program to another 4 million, paying for it with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes.\n\nBush said Congress knows the current version of the children's health bill \"does not have a chance,\" to get enough votes to override another veto.\n\nHoyer accused Bush of breaking a promise he made in 2004 to extend coverage under the SCHIP program. \"Now, Congress must do what the president said he would do,\" he said in his statement.\n\nThe Senate could vote on the bill as early as Tuesday.\n\nBush also threatened to veto a \"three-bill pileup.\" \"There are now reports that Congressional leaders may be considering combining the Veterans and Department of Defense appropriations bills, and then add a bloated labor, health and education spending bill to both of them,\" he said. \"Congress should pass each bill one at a time in a fiscally responsible manner,\" he said.\n\nBush also urged Congress to send him a \"clean defense appropriations bill and a war supplemental bill.\" \"They ought to get me a bill that funds among other things bullets and body armor,\" he said.\n\nBush also criticized Congress for trying to \"hold hostage\" funding for troops. \"It would be irresponsible to not give our troops the resources they need to get their job done because Congress was unable to get its job done,\" he said.\n\nHoyer's release said Bush's comments on appropriations bills and fiscal responsibility \"ring hollow.\" \"The fact is, this administration has pursued the most fiscally irresponsible policies in American history, turning record surpluses into record deficits and adding more than $3 trillion to the national debt,\" he said. \"Democrats are the party of fiscal responsibility today because we believe our government must pay for the things it purchases and not force our children to pay our bills.\n\nThe fight over 2008 appropriations bills is not a fight over spending.\n\nIt is a fight over priorities.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sniper Lee Boyd Malvo said in a letter to CNN that he is still \"grappling with shame, guilt, remorse and my own healing if that will ever be possible.\" And a social worker who has worked extensively with him said he draws self-portraits that often show him with a tear running down his cheek.\n\nA self-portrait drawn by sniper Lee Boyd Malvo.\n\nMany of his drawings show him with a tear running down his cheek.\n\nMalvo, 22, spends 23 hours a day inside his cell at Virginia's toughest prison, a maximum-security compound called Red Onion, not far from the Kentucky border.\n\nAccording to social worker Carmeta Albarus-Lindo, Malvo is a changed person since he and John Allen Muhammad terrorized the Washington area five years ago this month in attacks that left 10 dead over a 23-day period. \"The most I can do is to continue to be there, because that is his greatest fear -- that, you know, another parental figure would abandon him because that was what he'd been exposed to all his life,\" said Albarus-Lindo, who has spent hundreds of hours with Malvo since his arrest and conviction.\n\nShe said one of those \"parental\" figures was Muhammad, who met Malvo in the Caribbean nearly two years before the deadly shooting spree began in 2002.\n\nMuhammad became the teenager's surrogate father, convincing him that violence was the only way to correct perceived injustices to African-Americans, Albarus-Lindo said.\n\nHe ordered Malvo to go to bed each night and to memorize passages from \"The Art of War,\" an ancient Chinese text on battlefield strategy.\n\nAccording to Albarus-Lindo, Malvo was \"brainwashed\" into aiding Muhammad in the murders.\n\nHowever, prosecutors have said Malvo, even at 17, knew what he was doing. \"I thought he was coldblooded,\" said Paul Ebert, commonwealth attorney for Prince William County, Virginia, of the first time he met Malvo. \"He was a person who had chosen a life of crime.\" And when a Virginia jury spared Malvo's life, some investigators said they were horrified. \"That was the hardest day of my career,\" said April Carroll of the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco. \"I felt that day we had failed when Malvo was not sentenced to death.\" Some of the victims' families said they are content that Malvo did not receive the death penalty.\n\nVicki Buchanan Snyder, whose brother James \"Sonny\" Buchanan was shot in the back while mowing a patch of lawn at a Maryland auto dealership, said she was \"satisfied\" with the jury's verdict.\n\nAs for Malvo, Albarus-Lindo said he will \"never forgive himself for what has happened.\" When she first began seeing him, he still called Muhammad \"Dad.\" It took months, she said, before he stopped.\n\nIn the interim, Albarus-Lindo said, he took college correspondence courses and began to draw.\n\nMuhammad is at a Virginia prison called Sussex One.\n\nIn a DVD made last year inside prison and obtained exclusively by CNN, he said he is \"still fighting\" on death row.\n\nHe wants to \"correct,\" he said, some \"inaccurate statements\" made by the news media about his relationship with Malvo.\n\nMuhammad's ex-wife, Mildred, said she believed that she was the real target of the snipers from the beginning.\n\nShe and her children live in suburban Washington, and she runs a Web site called Afterthetrauma.org, devoted to the victims of domestic abuse.\n\nMildred Muhammad said she feels her ex-husband wanted to kill her as revenge because she was able to gain custody of their three children.\n\nAs for his relationship with Malvo, she said she too is convinced that John Allen Muhammad brainwashed the younger man. \"That boy was a victim before he even knew it,\" she said. \"His life was over when he said, 'Hi.' \" E-mail to a friend .",

    "text": "(CNN) -- Erik Prince, the chairman and CEO of Blackwater USA, appeared Tuesday before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n\nErik Prince, CEO and chairman of Blackwater USA, is sworn in Tuesday at a congressional hearing.\n\nThe committee convened amid an FBI investigation into a September 16 shootout involving Blackwater personnel that resulted in the deaths of Iraqi civilians.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of Prince's opening statement: .\n\nChairman [Henry] Waxman, [D-California], Congressman [Thomas] Davis, [R-Virginia], members of the committee, my name is Eric Prince, and I am the chairman and CEO of the Prince Group and Blackwater USA.\n\nBlackwater's a team of dedicated professionals who provide training to America's military and law enforcement communities and risk their lives to protect Americans in harm's way overseas.\n\nUnder the direction and oversight of the United States government, Blackwater provides an opportunity for military and law enforcement veterans with a record of honorable service to continue their support to the United States.\n\nWords alone cannot express the respect I have for these brave men and women who defend -- who volunteer to defend U.S. personnel facilities and diplomatic missions.\n\nI am proud to be there to represent them today.\n\nAfter almost five years in active service as a U.S.\n\nI wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues.\n\nTen years later, Blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the United States military and law enforcement agencies every day.\n\nAfter 9/11, when the U.S. began its stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and then Iraq, the United States government called upon Blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas.\n\nWe are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country.\n\nBlackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans, many of whom have recent military deployments.\n\nNo individual ever protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured.\n\nThere is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men.\n\nAt the same time, 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for Blackwater and its affiliates.\n\nNumerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed.\n\nThe entire Blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives.\n\nOur thoughts and our prayers are with their families.\n\nThe areas of Iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging.\n\nBlackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within Iraq.\n\nWe're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 American military personnel and thousands of innocent Iraqis.\n\nAny incident where Americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep American officials and dignitaries safe, including visiting members of Congress.\n\nIn doing so, more American service members are available to fight the enemy.\n\nBlackwater shares the committee's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting U.S. operations.\n\nThe company's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes, treaties and regulations of the United States.\n\nBlackwater looks forward to working with Congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented.\n\nThe worldwide personnel protection services contract, which has been provided to this committee, was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance, including the hiring, vetting guidelines, background checks, screening, training standards, rules of force and conduct standards.\n\nIn Iraq, Blackwater reports to the embassy's regional security officer, or RSO.\n\nAll Blackwater movements and operations are directed by the RSO.\n\nIn conjunction with internal company procedures and controls, the RSO ensures that Blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions, as well as any applicable laws and regulations.\n\nWe have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in Iraq as part of our nation's total force.\n\nBlackwater does not engage in offensive or military missions but performs only defensive security functions.\n\nMy understanding of the September 16 incident is that the Department of State and the FBI are conducting a full investigation, but those results are not yet available.\n\nWe at Blackwater welcome the FBI review announced yesterday, and we will cooperate fully and look forward to receiving their conclusions.\n\nI just want to put some other things in perspective.\n\nA recent report from the Department of State stated that in 2007 Blackwater conducted 1,873 security details for diplomatic visits to the red zone, areas outside the Green Zone in Iraq, and there have been only 56 incidences in which weapons were discharged, or less than 3 percent of all movements.\n\nIn 2006, Blackwater conducted over 6,500 diplomatic movements in the Red Zone.\n\nWeapons were discharged in less than 1 percent of those missions.\n\nTo the extent there is any loss of innocent life, ever, let me be clear that I consider that tragic.\n\nEvery life, whether American or Iraqi, is precious.\n\nI stress to the committee and to the American public, however, that I believe we acted appropriately at all times.",

    "title": "Sen. Clinton supported by 44 percent of Democrats polled, down from October .",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- With the election of the next president a year away, Sen.\n\nHillary Clinton remains the person to beat, a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll released Monday suggests.\n\nAs the countdown begins to November 4, 2008, the New York Democrat continues to dominate the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, and comes out ahead when voters are asked whether they prefer her or the GOP front-runner, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nBut Clinton's path to the White House is in no way certain.\n\nClinton was criticized for her performance during a debate last week, and her rivals for the Democratic nomination have stepped up attacks that she has equivocated on her position on Iraq, Iran and other major issues.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidates have also stepped up their attacks on the Democratic front-runner, with each suggesting that he has the best chance of stopping Clinton.\n\nThe CNN/Opinion Research polls suggests that Clinton's support has slipped from its height one month ago.\n\nWatch CNN's Bill Schneider on the latest poll numbers » . \"Clinton's strength is about where it was throughout the summer, indicating that she has lost the support she gained last month but that Obama has not yet cut into her core constituency,\" CNN political director Keating Holland said.\n\nClinton is the top choice of 44 percent of the likely Democratic voters interviewed for the poll.\n\nBarack Obama of Illinois, was the top choice of 25 percent, and former Sen.\n\nJohn Edwards of North Carolina has 14 percent.\n\nAll other Democratic candidates were in single digits.\n\nBill Richardson was backed by 4 percent, Sen.\n\nJoe Biden of Delaware by 3 percent, Sen.\n\nDennis Kucinich by 2 percent and former Alaska Sen.\n\nThe poll involved 467 interviews conducted on November 2-4 with Democrats or independents who lean Democratic.\n\nThe poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.\n\nIn an October CNN/Opinion Research poll, Clinton was supported by 51 percent of Democratic voters and had a 30 point lead over Obama.\n\nDuring last week's Democratic debate, Clinton received heavy criticism from her fellow Democratic presidential rivals, who are desperate to shake up the presidential race just months before the first voting occurs in the Iowa Caucus in early January.\n\nEdwards was particularly aggressive during the debate, criticizing Clinton for her stance on Iraq, Iran and Social Security. \"The American people ... deserve a president of the United States that they know will tell them the truth and won't say one thing one time and something different at a different time,\" Edwards said.\n\nEdwards has also accused Clinton of being a \"corporate Democrat\" too willing to defend a \"corrupt\" Washington establishement. \"We desperately need in the next president someone that recognizes we have a system in Washington that's become broken, corruption has crept into it, and we have to tell the truth about that,\" Edwards said Monday. \"If you defend that system, I don't believe you can bring about the change that America needs.\" In the Republican presidential race, Giuliani continues to be the leading candidate, with the backing of 28 percent of the Republican primary voters polled.\n\nFred Thompson of Tennessee was backed by 19 percent.\n\nJohn McCain of Arizona was the top pick of 16 percent, and former Massachusetts Gov.\n\nOf the remaining Republican candidates, former Arkansas Gov.\n\nThe poll involved telephone interviews with 397 Republicans or independents who lean Republican.\n\nThe poll's margin of error was 5 percentage points.\n\nIn a head-to-head matchup of the two front-runners, Clinton leads Giuliani 51 percent to 45 percent.\n\nThat lead has increased since October, when Clinton led Giuliani 49 percent to 47 percent. \"The overall political environment seems to favor the Democrats, partly because Democratic voters are more enthusiastic about the coming election and partly because the public is in a sour mood, which is usually not a good sign for the incumbent party,\" Holland said.\n\nOnly 42 percent of Americans think things are going well, while 58 percent think things are going badly, the poll found. \"The public is not just pessimistic about the country -- Americans are angry,\" Holland said. \"More than eight in 10 say they are angry about the way things are going in the country.\" Clinton's lead over Giuliani would be greater if a third-party candidate entered the race who believes abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, the poll found.\n\nIn a three-way race, Clinton would get the support of 48 percent of voters, Giuliani 32 percent and the third-party candidate 18 percent.\n\nThe poll's margin of error was plus-or-minus 3 percent. \"My analysis of it is that [a third-party candidate] is more of an attempt to keep the nomination from me,\" Giuliani said. \"You know it is a tactic, and a legitimate one.\n\nPeople have to think about that and consider it.'' The lack of enthusiasm for Giuliani, particularly by social conservatives, could spell trouble for the GOP next year if he becomes the nominee, Holland said. \"Only 27 percent of Republicans say they would feel enthusiastic if Giuliani won the GOP nod, and the remaining GOP candidates fare even worse,\" he said.",

    "text": "TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran should be allowed to pursue its nuclear program for peaceful purposes, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday during the first visit to the country by a Kremlin leader since 1943.\n\nPutin, right, is greeted by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad following his arrival in Tehran.\n\nPutin, who is in Tehran to attend a summit of Caspian Sea nations, said that he and the other leaders agreed that \"peaceful nuclear activities must be allowed\" in the region. \"The Iranians are cooperating with Russian nuclear agencies and the main objectives are peaceful objectives,\" he said.\n\nRussia is building Iran's first nuclear power plant and has resisted moves by the U.S. and its allies to impose stronger U.N. sanctions against Tehran.\n\nDefense Secretary Robert Gates reiterated the Bush administration's stance that \"all options\" must be kept \"on the table\" in confronting the threats posed by Iran -- a reference to the option of using military action against the long-time U.S. adversary. \"We should have no illusions about the nature of this regime or its leaders -- about their designs for their nuclear program, their willingness to live up to their rhetoric, their intentions for Iraq, or their ambitions in the Gulf region,\" Gates said in a speech to the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs.\n\nThe leaders of Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan also met Tuesday to reach agreement on issues relating to the sharing and regulating of the Caspian Sea -- the world's largest inland body of water.\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Putin said that no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third parties intent on military action against other countries in the region -- a reference to rumors that the U.S. planned to use Azerbaijan as a base for a possible attack against Iran, The Associated Press reported. \"We are saying that no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third powers for use of force or military aggression against any Caspian state,\" Putin said. \"The Caspian Sea is an inland sea and it only belongs to the Caspian states, therefore only they are entitled to have their ships and military forces here,\" added Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n\nPutin, defying reports of an assassination plot against him, was greeted by Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki as he stepped off his plane at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport.\n\nDuring a news conference Monday after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Wiesbaden, Germany, Putin said rumors of an attempt on his life would not stop his plans. \"Of course I will travel to Iran,\" Putin said. \"If I reacted to these kinds of rumors every time, I could never leave the house.\" Iranian officials denied there was an assassination plot against Putin, with a Foreign Ministry spokesman describing rumors of a possible terrorist action during the Putin visit baseless. \"Spreading this kind of totally false news lacks any value and cannot damage the trend of the prepared programs,\" spokesman Mohammadali Hosseini told the Iranian FARS news agency.\n\nHosseini blamed the rumor on Western media, particularly the U.S. media, saying the report was \"made up by the enemies of relations between Iran and Russia to create a psychological war.\" Putin's visit is the first by a leader in the Kremlin to Iran since Joseph Stalin's World War II conference meeting with U.S.\n\nRoosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. \"Putin's trip to Tehran is a show of Russia's independence in global affairs.\n\nPutin, who approaches the end of his term, wants to demonstrate that he wouldn't cave in to the U.S. pressure,\" said Alexander Pikayev, an expert on Iran with Russia's Institute for World Economy and International Relations, in a report carried by AP.\n\nPutin's schedule also includes meetings with Ahmadinejad and Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, AP said.\n\nAll rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.",

    "text": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Former detainees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation.\n\nRaymond Soeoth, pictured here with his wife, says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will.\n\nOne of the drugs in question is the potent anti-psychotic drug Haldol, which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses.\n\nDoctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered.\n\nTwo immigrants, Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia and Amadou Diouf of Senegal in West Africa, told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will.\n\nBoth are plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the government.\n\nThey are seeking an end to the alleged practice and unspecified damages.\n\nWatch why the former detainees claim abuse » .\n\nPaul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry, law and ethics at Columbia University, reviewed both men's medical records for this report and was stunned by what he discovered. \"I'm really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way,\" said Appelbaum, who also serves as a member of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law. \"That is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world.\" The allegations of ICE forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by Sen.\n\nJoe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, during the re-nomination hearing of ICE chief Julie Myers. \"The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling, particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards,\" Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail. \"Senator Lieberman intends to follow up with ICE to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so.\" ACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham, who is representing Soeoth and Diouf, said, \"It would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who isn't even mentally ill. ...\n\nBut here, it's happening on U.S. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport.\" Responding to Lieberman's written questions, Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had \"medical escorts\" for deportation since 2003.\n\nFrom October last year to the end of April this year, she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process.\n\nOf those, 33 detainees received medication \"because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self,\" she said. \"First, I am aware of, and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards,\" Myers said.\n\nShe added no detainee should be \"involuntarily medicated without court order,\" except in emergency situations.\n\nBut both Soeoth and Diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior.\n\nSoeoth, a Christian minister from Indonesia, spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected.\n\nHours before he was to be sent back home on December 7, 2004, he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days.\n\nSee the document that shows Soeoth was injected . \"They pushed me on the bench, they opened my pants, and they just give me injection,\" he said through broken English.\n\nHe says he was taken to Los Angeles International Airport while in this drug-induced stupor, but two hours before takeoff, airline security refused to transport him, so ICE agents returned him to his cell at Terminal Island near Los Angeles.\n\nTerminal Island, once a federal prison, is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation.\n\nSoeoth's medical records indicate he was injected with Cogentin and Haldol, even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness.\n\nIn the records, the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making.\n\nICE said in a written statement it couldn't respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation. \"Department of Homeland Security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees,\" the ICE statement said. \"Only trained and qualified medical professionals, including officers of the U.S.\n\nPublic Health Service, may prescribe or administer medication.\" But, Diouf says, he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported.\n\nHe said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his U.S. government escorts wouldn't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country.\n\nThat's when, he says, \"I was wrestled to the ground and injected through my clothes.\" A government report says he was medicated because he did not follow orders.\n\nIn both cases, Diouf and Soeoth remain in the United States pending a decision in the case.\n\nIf they lose, they may land back in the hands of ICE, once again facing deportation.\n\nSoeoth says he's traumatized by what happened. \"I know this country [is] very generous to immigrants,\" he says. \"What they did to me was very, very bad.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nCNN's Wayne Drash, Traci

    "text": "LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- A young girl shown on video being sexually assaulted was raped while in the care of a baby sitter her mother hired, the mother's attorney said Tuesday.\n\nChester Arthur Stiles, 37, of Nevada is being sought as a suspect in the videotaped rape of a young girl.\n\nThe mother did not know her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until last Friday, Jerry T.\n\nDonohue said. \"A family friend called her and said, 'My God, you need to turn on the TV.\n\nI believe that is your daughter,'\" he said.\n\nDonohue said the mother recognized the suspect, Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, a former animal trainer.\n\nThe abuse most likely occurred while the mother - a single woman working six days a week - was at work, Donohue said.\n\nThe attorney said he knows who the baby sitter is, but would not release that information because of the ongoing investigation.\n\nEarlier, officials had said the girl, who is now 7, was 3-years-old at the time the video was made.\n\nBut Donohue said Tuesday, \"To my understanding, the abuse occurred before she was 3 years old.\" The mother of the girl asked that the news media leave the family alone. \"I want to ask you, the press, to respect my family's privacy and to not attempt to contact my daughter or myself,\" the mother said in a written statement read by her attorney.\n\nWatch Donohue read the mother's statement » .\n\nThe mother also said she is cooperating with investigators and that her daughter \"is safe and healthy.\" The girl's videotaped rape set off a nationwide search last week.\n\nShe was found Friday with family in Las Vegas, Nevada, after thousands of tips poured in.\n\nProfessionals have since evaluated her and she appears to be \"healthy and fine and happy,\" the lawyer said.\n\nThe lawyer said neither he nor the mother has watched the videotape.\n\nAsked whether the mother is thankful to the news media for having published the girl's picture so that authorities were able to identify her, Donohue said, \"Not really ... there's some things maybe you don't want to know.\" Still, he said, he hopes the man in the tape is brought to justice. \"Speaking as a father myself, I wish the guy would dig a hole in the desert and put a gun in his mouth,\" he said, referring to such an outcome as \"Wild-West justice.\" Meanwhile, the intense manhunt for Stiles continued Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, Stiles' former girlfriend, Tina Allen, told CNN she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is \"mortified\" by the allegations against him.\n\nAllen said she and Stiles were in an on-again, off-again relationship for 10 years until recently, when she called it off. \"He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,\" Allen said.\n\nAllen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived.\n\nAlso living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, who allegedly was victimized by Stiles. \"I'm disgusted.\n\nI'm ashamed, embarrassed, mortified,\" Allen said of the alleged rape. \"I regret every, every step I ever took, I feel bad for the baby.\" The FBI is also seeking Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, in a separate matter involving state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14.\n\nPahrump is about 60 miles west of Las Vegas.\n\nA man who said he found the tape in the desert and held it for at least five months before handing it over to authorities turned himself in Sunday to Nye County officials.\n\nDarren Tuck, a Nevada resident who allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography.",

    "text": "Barack Obama on Thursday criticized a recent vote by Democratic presidential rival Sen.\n\nHillary Clinton as helping to give President Bush a \"blank check\" to take military action against Iran.\n\nHillary Clinton has shown \"flawed\" judgment. \"We know in the past that the president has used some of the flimsiest excuses to try to move his agenda regardless of what Congress says,\" Obama said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer.\n\nLast month, Clinton voted to support a resolution declaring Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite part of the Iranian military, a foreign terrorist group. (The nonbinding amendment to the Defense Authorization Act passed by a 76-22 vote.) Obama said he would have voted against the measure but didn't because he was campaigning in New Hampshire at the time.\n\nHe said it was impossible to know when votes will be scheduled in the Senate. \"This is a problem\" related to running for president, he said.\n\nObama said Clinton also had shown \"flawed\" judgment during the vote to authorize the Iraq war five years ago. \"We know that there was embodied in this legislation, or this resolution sent to the Senate, language that would say our Iraqi troop structures should in part be determined by our desire to deal with Iran,\" Obama said. \"Now if you know that in the past the president has taken a blank check and cashed it, we don't want to repeat that mistake.\" Clinton on Thursday defended her vote on the resolution during an interview on New Hampshire Public Radio, saying \"what I voted on was a nonbinding resolution.\n\nIt's not a law.\" While Clinton was campaigning Sunday in New Hampton, Iowa, an audience member at a town hall-style meeting pressed her on why she voted for the Iran measure and asked why she hadn't learned from past \"mistakes.\" Calling \"the premise of the question\" wrong, the senator from New York argued the resolution calls for the terrorist label so that sanctions can be imposed.\n\nThe sanctions, Clinton said, will in turn \"send a clear message to the leadership\" and lead to stronger diplomatic efforts.\n\nEarlier this month, Clinton also co-sponsored legislation with Sen.\n\nJim Webb, D-Virginia, that would prohibit military operations against Iran without congressional approval.\n\nObama's comments came on the fifth anniversary of the 77-23 Senate vote that authorized the president to use force against Iraq.\n\nObama, then an Illinois state senator, spoke out against the resolution authorizing force at the time.\n\nClinton's 2002 vote shows a clear difference in judgment between the two of them, Obama said.\n\nWatch as Obama questions Clinton's judgment » . \"I don't think it disqualified her, but I think it speaks to her judgment and it speaks to my judgment,\" Obama said. \"It speaks to how we will make decisions going forward. \"I think her judgment was flawed on this issue.\" Obama said he also will step up efforts to clarify his differences with Clinton, whom many political observers view as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. \"There's no doubt we are moving into a different phase of the campaign,\" Obama said. \"The first part of a campaign is to offer some biography and give people a sense of where I've been and what I am about. \"In this next phase, we want to make sure that voters understand that on big issues, like the decision to go into the war in Iraq, I had real differences with the other candidates, and that reflects on my judgment.\" Another leading Democratic candidate, John Edwards, also voted in 2002 to authorize force in Iraq while he was then a senator from North Carolina.\n\nIn a veiled swipe at Clinton, Obama also suggested he could better unite the country and offer \"something new, as opposed to looking backward and simply duplicating some of the politics that we've become so accustomed to, that frankly the American people are sick of.\" Obama would not say whether he would consider Clinton as his running mate should he become the Democratic Party's nominee. \"I think Sen.\n\nClinton is a very capable person,\" he said. \"Right now, my goal is to make sure I am the nominee, and she is still the senator from New York.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nCNN's Scott Anderson and Alexander Mooney contributed to this report.",

    "text": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- After his weekend arrest on gun charges, rapper T.I. will remain in custody until a bond hearing Friday, a federal magistrate said Monday.\n\nT.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested without incident in midtown Atlanta.\n\nThe entertainer, whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested Saturday just hours before he was scheduled to perform at the BET Hip Hop Awards.\n\nThe small court room of Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman was packed with family, supporters and media, but even more people, including the rapper's mother, were turned away because of the overcrowding.\n\nHarris, 27, was arrested in a federal sting after his bodyguard-turned-informant delivered three machine guns and two silencers to the hip-hop star, according to a Justice Department statement.\n\nHe was held in federal custody over the weekend.\n\nAuthorities said that Harris provided the bodyguard $12,000 to buy the weapons, which Harris is not allowed to own because he is a convicted felon.\n\nCourt documents said Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in 1998, and a federal affidavit said he has been arrested on gun charges in the past.\n\nHowever, one of his attorneys, Dwight Thomas, said he was not aware Harris was a convicted felon and that \"a number of people\" live in Harris' suburban Atlanta home.\n\nThomas added there were \"two sides to every story -- sometimes three\" and he was confident the legal system would work in Harris' favor.\n\nThe entertainer was taken into custody about 2:30 p.m.\n\nSaturday in Atlanta, where the BET award show was taped.\n\nHarris, the show's top nominee, was up for nine awards, including CD of the year and lyricist of the year.\n\nHe also was scheduled to perform, along with fellow rap stars Common, Nelly and Kanye West.\n\nThe show went on without the self-proclaimed \"King of the South,\" whose car and home in the Atlanta suburb of College Park were searched after his arrest.\n\nAuthorities said they found three more firearms in the car in which Harris drove to pick up the machine guns and silencers, \"including one loaded gun tucked between the driver's seat where Harris had been sitting and the center console.\" At his home, authorities found six other guns, five of them loaded, in his bedroom closet. \"Machine guns pose a serious danger to the community, which is why they are so carefully regulated,\" said David Nahmias, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. \"The last place machine guns should be is in the hands of a convicted felon, who cannot legally possess any kind of firearm.\n\nThis convicted felon allegedly was trying to add several machine guns to an already large and entirely illegal arsenal of guns.\" The sting came after Harris' bodyguard was arrested purchasing the machine guns and silencers from an undercover Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Wednesday, according to the Justice Department statement.\n\nThe bodyguard then agreed to cooperate with the ATF, the statement said.\n\nThe guns were not registered on the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record as required by law.\n\nThe bodyguard -- who has worked for Harris since July -- told authorities he had bought about nine guns for the rap star in the past, the statement said.\n\nOn Wednesday, authorities said, Harris arranged for the bodyguard to pick up $12,000 in cash from a bank to buy the guns.\n\nAfter his arrest, the bodyguard made phone calls to Harris, which authorities recorded, the statement said.\n\nHarris was supposed to meet the bodyguard in a shopping center parking lot in midtown Atlanta to pick up the guns.\n\nAuthorities arrested Harris there without incident, the Justice Department statement said.\n\nCourt documents in the case show Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in Cobb County, Georgia, in 1998 and sentenced to seven years' probation. \"Harris has additional arrests and at least one probation violation for unlawfully possessing firearms,\" according to an affidavit.\n\nHarris' music is built around the drug culture and is known as \"trap musik,\" the name of Harris' second album.\n\nA \"trap\" is Southern slang for a drug house.\n\nHarris soon will appear in the movie \"American Gangster,\" starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe.\n\nCNN's Mike Phelan and Catherine Callaway contributed to this report.",

    "text": "EL CALABOZ, Texas (CNN) -- Eloisa Tamez said she isn't scared anymore, just determined. \"I am not backing down,\" she said.\n\nThe U.S. government wants to build a border fence like this one.\n\nTamez owns three acres of land along the Texas-Mexico border where the Department of Homeland Security would like to build a border fence.\n\nThe property is a remnant of a 12,000-acre grant from Spain to her family in 1767, before the United States even existed. \"It is my history.\n\nThis week, the Justice Department began legal action against landowners and municipalities who have refused to give government surveyors access to their land.\n\nTamez expects she will be sued sometime soon, but she is not intimidated.\n\nAsked how long she will fight, she said, \"As long as I have to.\" Michael Chertoff, the Secretary of Homeland Security, said the fence will not be stopped by opponents like Tamez. \"Can we simply abandon an enterprise because it is a problem for a particular individual?\" Chertoff told CNN. \"I don't think I can accept that.\" Watch Chertoff say it's \"civic responsibility\" to give up land » .\n\nChertoff believes a fence would curb the steady stream of illegal immigrants making their way across the border and lessen the flow of drugs.\n\nHe also argues it will increase the safety of Border Patrol agents who have faced increasing violence.\n\nThe government wants to build 700 miles of fence along the Mexican border, including 370 miles of it by the end of this year.\n\nAbout 70 miles of fence is to be built in the Rio Grande Valley by year's end, if the government gets its way.\n\nThe Rio Grande forms a natural barrier along this stretch of the border, but in some places it is narrow enough to swim across.\n\nOn the banks of the river there is ample evidence that people do so.\n\nPiles of underwear lie discarded by swimmers after they make it across.\n\nThe swimmers change into dry clothes they have carried across in plastic bags.\n\nThe Border Patrol has stepped up its efforts in the Rio Grande Valley with more lights, and sensors to pick up movement.\n\nA levee built along the river has a muddy road on top used by Border Patrol vehicles to patrol the area.\n\nRichard Cortez, the mayor of the border town of McAllen, Texas, believes hiring more Border Patrol agents, deepening the Rio Grande, and clearing its banks of tall vegetation would provide better border protection than the fence.\n\nCortez calls the fence \"a multibillion-dollar speed bump,\" which will slow, but not stop, illegal immigration. \"It is a false sense of security,\" he said. \"America will not be safe.\n\nAmerica will continue to waste resources on something that is not going to work.\" Cortez and other border mayors who oppose construction of the fence formed a group called the Texas Border Coalition.\n\nThe coalition wrote to Chertoff asking for further consultations on the fence, but this week the Department of Homeland Security turned them down.\n\nWhile expressing support for open dialogue with residents and officials, David Pagan of U.S.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection wrote in an e-mail, \"We do not plan to suspend work on the construction of fence in order to hold a series of additional consultation meetings.\" Cortez said his city is contemplating a court test of the law that mandated the construction of the border fence.\n\nAnd so a battle is being waged by about 100 landowners, those like Eloisa Tamez who are standing firm. \"I will not allow them to come and survey my land.\n\nI have an American-given right to protect my property,\" she said.",

    "text": "TAMPA, Florida (CNN) -- Some Christian congregations, particularly in lower income, urban areas, are turning to an unlikely source for help -- the Church of Scientology.\n\nRon Hubbard's book during a Friday night sermon.\n\nScientologists do not worship God, much less Jesus Christ.\n\nThe church has seen plenty of controversy and critics consider it a cult.\n\nSo why are observant Christians embracing some of its teachings?\n\nTwo pastors who spoke recently with CNN explained that when it comes to religion, they still preach the core beliefs of Christianity.\n\nBut when it comes to practicing what they preach in a modern world, borrowing from Scientology helps.\n\nCharles Kennedy, of the Glorious Church of God in Christ, a Pentecostal church in Tampa, Florida, and the Rev.\n\nJames McLaughlin, of the Wayman Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Houston, Texas, are among the theological hybrids.\n\nThey say they are not scared off by programs with ties to a church that critics say has aggressive recruiting, secretive ways and rigid theology.\n\nAs men of God rooted in Christian values, they do not see Scientology as a threat to their faith, but rather as a tool to augment it.\n\nScientology was founded in the 1950s by L.\n\nFollowers are taught that they are immortal spiritual beings called thetans.\n\nAlthough the church says there is a supreme being, its practices do not include worshipping God. \"I'm looking for solutions, and the people that I help, they don't ask me who L.\n\nRon Hubbard is,\" said McLaughlin, who works with addicts. \"You know what they say? 'Thank God.' \" Critic Rick Ross, a court-certified Scientology expert, sees something more sinister at work.\n\nHe warned that mainstream acceptance makes it easier for the Scientologists to achieve their ultimate goal -- new recruits. \"Their hope is that through these programs, people will become more interested in L.\n\nHubbard had to offer, and this will lead them eventually to Scientology,\" Ross said.\n\nThe church has long been in the headlines for practices critics say are little more than cult-like mind control.\n\nIt is also known for its stable of devout celebrity followers.\n\nAnd according to published reports, Scientology has been recently diversifying its outreach to include other religions and ethnic groups.\n\nKennedy, McLaughlin and a handful of other Christian church leaders -- no one can say how many -- are finding answers to their communities' needs in Scientology's social programs.\n\nFor Kennedy, it began two years ago when he attended a meeting at the Church of Scientology's spiritual headquarters in Clearwater, Florida.\n\nHe was introduced to a book called \"The Way to Happiness\" -- Hubbard's 64-page, self-described \"common sense guide to better living.\" In the book, which lays out ways to maintain a temperate lifestyle, Kennedy found a message he believed could help lift his predominantly lower income African-American congregation.\n\nHe said the book's 21 principles help them with their struggle in an urban environment where there is too much crime and addiction and too little opportunity.\n\nKennedy knew that before he could introduce any Scientology-related text to his congregation, he would have to prove that it did not contradict his Christian beliefs.\n\nAnd so, he found Scripture to match each of the 21 principles.\n\nNow Kennedy uses \"The Way to Happiness\" as a how-to supplement to his sermons.\n\nHe believes it is easier to understand and clearer to follow than ancient Scriptures taken from the Bible.\n\nWhen asked whether Scientology's values contradict the religion of Jesus Christ, Kennedy replies, \"Sometimes yes.\n\nSometimes no.\" But he says his congregation can relate to \"The Way to Happiness.\" Kennedy admits other pastors have criticized him, but the disapproval is not enough to discourage him.\n\nHe insists that he has witnessed the changes \"The Way to Happiness\" has inspired in people.\n\nHe also maintains that the Scientologists, many of whom he calls friends, are successful at outreach and getting desired results.\n\nKennedy Center, free tutoring based on Hubbard's \"study tech\" philosophies is provided to dozens of children and some adults.\n\nKennedy's daughter, Jimirra, is one of the instructors.\n\nShe said \"study tech\" and the Scientology orientation classes she attended helped her graduate from high school and become a poised woman.\n\nThough Jimirra Kennedy insists she does not ascribe to the religious side of Scientology, she still considers herself, at least in part, Scientologist. \"We say this all the time and I know my father says this, but I am like a Pentecostal Scientologist, that's what we are.\" Critics like Ross are alarmed by such a blurring of the lines.\n\nThey consider it a marketing win for Scientology.\n\nIn Houston, McLaughlin says he is not one to argue with success.\n\nDriven by a need to address the rampant drug problem in his community, McLaughlin spent years searching for a solution before he discovered \"Narconon,\" Scientology's nonprofit drug rehab center, in 2001.\n\nMcLaughlin trained at Narconon and brought the techniques back to his community to launch \"First Step Faith Step,\" a program that combines Hubbard's methods with the teachings of Christianity.\n\nHe claims a 70- to 80-percent rehabilitation success rate.\n\nKennedy and McLaughlin said they have never lost a member of their congregations to Scientology. \"I think that they truly believe that this may help their communities, but in my opinion, they're naïve,\" Ross said.\n\nScientologists, he added, \"have their own agenda.\" The Church of Scientology would not grant CNN an interview, nor would its representatives answer questions about the Hubbard-based programs.",

(Superdelegates are party leaders and elected officials who are not obligated to support a particular candidate.\n\nThey can change their decisions at any time leading up to the Democratic National Convention in August.) To date, Obama has won an estimated 63 national convention delegates as a result of primary or caucus votes, while Clinton has earned an estimated 48 delegates.\n\nClinton, however, has the overall lead in delegates -- 232 to 158 -- when superdelegates are included.\n\nWith solid fundraising numbers and a nod from Sen.\n\nEdward Kennedy of Massachusetts this week, Obama will be making the claim he holds the front-runner title.\n\nBut Clinton -- who has led in national surveys for much of the race -- will be making her case as well.",

response to the spill.\n\nSome lawmakers, including one of the state's U.S. senators, Democrat Barbara Boxer, have criticized the Coast Guard's handling of the collision and resulting spill.\n\nBoxer said the Coast Guard initially reported that the ship's owner had said only 140 gallons had spilled from the Cosco Busan.\n\nBoxer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California have called for congressional hearings into the accident and resulting spill.\n\nAlthough Allen conceded some confusion in the Coast Guard's communication, he said it did not reflect their response. \"Response was set into play within an hour of the event itself,\" Allen said Monday.\n\nRegarding the initial low estimate of 140 gallons of lost oil, Allen said heavy fog and damage to the ship's tanks hindered initial aerial and on-ground evaluations of how much oil had leaked from the ship.\n\nIn addition to federal prosecutors, the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the accident, and NTSB spokeswoman Debbie Hersman said Sunday that agency was interviewing the pilot, the ship's crew, and other pilots who were on the water at the time of Wednesday's crash.\n\nThe crew had been on its inaugural voyage on the ship, which the current owner purchased last month, Hersman said.\n\nThe NTSB also intends to review the ship's voyage data recorder, which should have recorded captain and crew conversations on the bridge and other information in the 12 hours leading up to the bridge collision, Hersman said.\n\nThe oil spill has sparked concern among local officials and environmentalists.\n\nAs of Sunday, 23 beaches in the area remained closed.\n\nAngel Island State Park, the Bay's largest island, reopened Monday, the Coast Guard said.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency, freeing money to clean up the spill.\n\nSeven miles of containment boom stretched across the bay has collected more than 12,271 gallons of oil so far, and another 4,000 gallons have evaporated, officials said.\n\nNearly 400 dead birds have been recovered from the bay, while another 500 birds have been rescued alive but soaked in oil, according to Lisa Curtis, administrator of the Department of Fish and Games Office of Spill Prevention and Response.\n\nIn 1989, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground and fouled Alaska's Prince William Sound with almost 11 million gallons of crude -- the nation's worst ever oil spill.\n\nThousands of birds and animals died in the disaster, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nOften birds and animals are threatened when they come in contact with the oil and swallow it as they try to clean themselves, said the NOAA Web site.\n\nIn addition to birds, oil spills can be very harmful to fish and shellfish, NOAA said.\n\nTwenty wildlife teams were scheduled Monday to be the bay, working to find sick birds so they can be rehabilitated, Curtis said.\n\nOn Sunday, the state's other U.S. senator and a leading Coast Guard official decried the accident. \"This an incident which, in my view, should not have happened,\" Sen.\n\nDianne Feinstein, D-California, said Sunday after being briefed by Coast Guard officials.\n\nBone, the Coast Guard's director of inspection and compliance, echoed Feinstein's comments. \"This incident should have never ever occurred,\" he said. \"There's systems, there's capabilities, there's licensed operators, there's a pilot on board the vessel, there's the capacity and the capability to safely navigate through this port and waterways every day.\" He added, \"But we have to move beyond the incident and the fact that it occurred and move forward into the response.\" The California Department of Transportation said the collision did no structural damage to the bridge and there was no interruption of bridge traffic -- more than 250,000 vehicles daily.",

    "title": "Journalist spent a year looking for the world's happiest countries .",
    "text": "(CNN) -- It may take a lot of frequent-flier miles, a penchant for cold places, a tolerance of taxes and regular doses of chocolate, but happiness could be within reach.\n\nHowever, it's not where most people might expect.\n\nJournalist Eric Weiner says he wanted to explore the relationship between place and happiness.\n\nJust ask Eric Weiner, who made it his mission to find the most content places around the globe, uncovering lots of surprises along the way.\n\nA warm climate doesn't necessarily make a happy nation, Weiner said.\n\nWeiner, who wrote the book, \"The Geography of Bliss: One Grump's Search for the Happiest Places in the World,\" began his quest for very personal reasons. \"I'm an unhappy person, so it's kind of what prompts a hungry person to search for food,\" he said.\n\nWeiner spent 10 years as a foreign correspondent for National Public Radio, a job that took him to some of the least happy places in the world.\n\nIt was enough to send him on a yearlong journey to look for just the opposite.\n\nWeiner mapped out his quest with a combination of scientific and personal methods, choosing some countries because they traditionally score high on happiness surveys and selecting others to see how factors like money play a role.\n\nA world map of happiness, based on 100 different studies and produced by Britain's University of Leicester in 2006, listed Denmark as the world's happiest nation.\n\nBut for Weiner, the place where he felt the most bliss was a toss-up between Bhutan and Iceland, countries that ranked eighth and fourth, respectively, on the happiness map.\n\nWeiner's list of favorites also included Thailand, India and Switzerland.\n\nSee photos of his favorites and listen to him explain why they're happy » .\n\nHis top two picks, though very different countries, have unconventional paths to happiness, he said. \"Bhutan is probably the closest thing on Earth to Shangri-La, that fictional paradise,\" Weiner explained.\n\nHe pointed out that while other countries focus on their gross domestic product, the Himalayan kingdom proudly touts its policy of \"gross national happiness.\" \"The Bhutanese very much believe that happiness should be part and parcel of every government decision,\" Weiner said.\n\nThousands of miles away, Weiner found happiness in a very different environment, marveling at the creativity and \"coziness\" of Iceland. \"Everyone in Iceland is a poet,\" Weiner recalled.\n\nHe visited the country during winter and said he found a certain beauty in the cold and the darkness.\n\nSuch a chilly climate usually encourages warm relationships, Weiner found. \"The cold inspires people to cooperate, traditionally.\n\nIf you go back a few hundred years, people in cold climates have to cooperate or they die together.\n\nWeiner found a different flavor of happiness in Switzerland, where he discovered people are content partly because everything runs like clockwork.\n\nSimple pleasures like trains arriving on time contributed to national happiness, he said.\n\nBut there may be a much sweeter reason why Switzerland is a happy place. \"The Swiss eat a lot of chocolate, and let's not forget that,\" Weiner said.\n\nHe was also impressed with how the Swiss view money. \"Their attitude is that if you've got it, hide it.\n\nWhile our attitude is if you've got it, flaunt it,\" Weiner said, comparing the Swiss to Americans.\n\nWeiner called the United States, which came in at No. 23 on the University of Leicester's world map of happiness, a nation that \"is not as happy as it is wealthy.\" The impact of wealth and taxes .\n\nThe relationship between money and happiness took Weiner to the Middle East and Qatar, a country with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, thanks to oil and natural gas revenues, according to the CIA World Factbook. \"I went there specifically to examine what happens when the entire country wins the lottery,\" Weiner said.\n\nHe found the wealth made the residents comfortable, but also degraded their level of contentment. \"Most of our happiness is derived from our relationships with other people,\" Weiner said. \"The money in Qatar has allowed them to wall themselves off, literally and figuratively, from other people. ...\n\nThat's not a recipe for happiness.\" There are no income taxes in Qatar, but that's not a cause for contentment, Weiner found.\n\nSome taxation is necessary for happiness because it's a way of being invested in a place, he argued. \"You're giving money to someone else, a government, and you're trusting them to do something good with it,\" Weiner said. \"In a country where there's no taxation at all, people don't have vested interests in how well the government performs.\n\nYou can't say, 'Hey, those are my tax dollars at work.'\" Quest creates buzz .\n\nWeiner's book has struck a chord, recently rising to the top 10 of The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list.\n\nAn expert who studies happiness said part of the book's appeal may lie in how Weiner mapped out his journey. \"He arranges an interesting itinerary because he uses science as his compass,\" said Daniel Gilbert, a psychology professor at Harvard University and the author of \"Stumbling on Happiness.\" Gilbert said it's only recently that a combination of biology, sociology and psychology has been able to answer the \"where's and why's\" of happiness, a subject that has always fascinated people. \"The quest for happiness is the central preoccupation of human beings and has been for as long as there have been human beings,\" Gilbert said.\n\nHe echoed Weiner's findings that bliss is other people. \"Everyone has been telling us for the longest time that happiness is about social relationships, well, bingo, they're right,\" Gilbert said.\n\nMeanwhile, after a year of exploring some of the world's happiest places, Weiner -- the self-described \"grump\" -- said his mind-set has improved somewhat. \"I would describe myself as a recovering grump,\" Weiner said. \"At this point, I think I am marginally happier than before I started the project.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "title": "Woman sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in jail under Islamic law .",
    "text": "(CNN) -- A Saudi Arabian human rights attorney is asking the government to allow him to represent a woman who was gang-raped -- and then sentenced to prison for speaking out about the case.\n\nHuman rights groups want Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim.\n\nThe attorney, Abdulrahman al-Lahim, had his license revoked last week by a judge for speaking to the Saudi-controlled media about the case, al-Lahim told CNN.\n\nThe judge more than doubled the sentence against al-Lahim's 19-year-old client because she spoke to the media about the case, a court source told Arab News, an English-language Middle Eastern daily newspaper.\n\nThe woman -- who was initially sentenced in October 2006 to 90 lashes -- had her sentenced increased to 200 lashes and was ordered to serve six months in prison under Saudi Arabia's strict Islamic law. \"We were shocked,\" al-Lahim said of the increased sentence.\n\nCNN has been unable to reach Saudi government officials for comment on this report, despite repeated requests.\n\nWatch the emotional toll the crime took on the rape victim » .\n\nAl-Lahim had petitioned the court to sentence the attackers to the death penalty, but instead the court agreed to increase their jail sentences, which had been two to three years, to two to nine years, al-Lahim said.\n\nThe case has sparked outrage among human rights groups. \"Barring the lawyer from representing the victim in court is almost equivalent to the rape crime itself,\" said Fawzeyah al-Oyouni, founding member of the newly formed Saudi Association for the Defense of Women's Rights. \"This is not just about the girl, it's about every woman in Saudi Arabia,\" she said. \"We're fearing for our lives and the lives of our sisters and our daughters and every Saudi woman out there.\n\nWe're afraid of going out in the streets.\" Human Rights Watch said it has called on Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah \"to immediely void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer.\" The woman, who is married, and an unrelated man were abducted and she was raped by a group of seven men more than a year ago, the lawyer said.\n\nThe male victim was also given an increased sentence of 200 lashes and six months in prison, al-Lahim said.\n\nThe man and woman were attacked after they met so she could retrieve an old photograph of herself from him, according to al-Lahim.\n\nCiting phone records from the police investigation, al-Lahim said the man was trying to blackmail his client.\n\nHe noted the photo she was trying to retrieve was harmless and did not show his client in any compromising position.\n\nAl-Lahim said the man tried to blame his client for insisting on meeting him that day.\n\nIt is illegal for a woman to meet with an unrelated male under Saudi's Islamic law.\n\nAl-Lahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Justice next month, where he faces a possible three-year suspension and disbarment, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nHe told CNN he has appealed to the Ministry of Justice to reinstate his law license and plans to meet with Justice Minister Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim Al Al-Sheikh. \"Currently she doesn't have a lawyer, and I feel they're doing this to isolate her and deprive her from her basic rights,\" he said. \"We will not accept this judgment and I'll do my best to continue representing her because justice needs to take place.\" He said the handling of the case is a direct contradiction of judicial reforms announced by the Saudi king earlier this month. \"The Ministry of Justice needs to have a very clear standing regarding this case because I consider this decision to be judiciary mutiny against the reform that King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz started and against Saudi women who are being victimized because of such decisions,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Islamic law or sharia is not written and, therefore, subject to a wide array of interpretations.\n\nHuman Rights Watch points out that a judge in Jeddah threw out a lawyer simply because he was a member of the Ismaili faith, a branch of Shia Islam.\n\nUnder Saudi law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery.\n\nWomen are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man, and they are not allowed to vote.\n\nThe Saudi government recently has taken some steps toward bettering the situation of women in the kingdom, including the establishment earlier this year of special courts to handle domestic abuse cases, adoption of a new labor law that addresses working women's rights and creation of a human rights commission.\n\nChristoph Wilcke of Human Rights Watch praised the female rape victim and her attorney for speaking out about the case, which he said may be indicative of \"many injustices that we still don't know about.\" \"It's not only one court, it is the Saudi government that is fully behind punishing a woman who's been raped [and] punishing the lawyer who's trying to help her and doing that both because they've spoken to the media,\" Wilcke told CNN. \"And if they hadn't spoken to the media, we wouldn't know about it.\" Shying away from criticism of key ally, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack called the case and the punishment \"surprising\" and \"astonishing.\" \"While this is a judicial procedure -- part of a judicial procedure -- overseas in courts outside of our country, still while it is very difficult to offer any detailed comment about this situation, I think most people would be quite astonished by the situation, \" McCormack said. \"I can't get involved in specific court cases in Saudi Arabia dealing with its own citizens.\n\nBut most people here would be quite surprised to learn of the circumstances and then the punishment meted out,\" he said.\n\nCNN's Saad Abedine and Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report .",

    "text": "OMAHA, Nebraska (CNN) -- Investigators probing the deadly mall shooting in Omaha have seized computers and are analyzing information on Web sites in the search for clues in the case, police said Thursday.\n\nThe 19-year-old gunman sent at least one text message to his former girlfriend, with whom he broke up about two weeks ago, Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren said.\n\nRobert Hawkins also left a voice mail for his mother before killing eight people at a department store Wednesday.\n\nHe chose his victims randomly, police believe, then took his own life.\n\nHawkins visited a friend near the Westroads Mall before the shootings and apparently went directly to the shopping center after that meeting, Warren said.\n\nPolice don't yet know why Hawkins chose the mall or the Von Maur department store in particular, Warren said, adding only that the teen \"may have frequented the Westroads Mall.\" See who Hawkins killed in department store » .\n\nThe incident itself appeared to be premeditated, as Hawkins left a suicide note and other correspondence, Warren said.\n\nWatch officials detail the rampage » . \"Typically there are hints that something like this may take place,\" Warren said. \"Certainly you can't anticipate someone engaging in this type of shooter rampage, but if there is any justification, any explanation,\" police will find it, he said. \"Apparently he had been experiencing some mental health problems, ideations of suicide.\" Debora Maruca-Kovac -- a friend of Hawkins' family who was letting him live in her home -- found the suicide note just minutes before the shootings.\n\nWatch her describe their last conversation » . \"He basically said how sorry he was for everything,\" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. \"He didn't want to be a burden to people and that he was a piece of s all of his life and that now he'd be famous.\" Warren said the rifle used was an AK-47.\n\nPolice haven't finished tracing the gun, but believe Hawkins stole it from his stepfather's home.\n\nSecurity officers flagged Hawkins as suspicious when he entered the mall.\n\nHe left soon after he entered, then returned less than six minutes later with something apparently hidden in a balled-up sweatshirt.\n\nHe went up an elevator to the mall's third floor, then immediately began firing, ultimately turning the firearm on himself, Warren said. \"It doesn't appear as though there was an opportunity for intervention,\" Warren said.\n\nHawkins fired more than 30 rounds, the police chief said.\n\nThe shootings sent panicked holiday shoppers fleeing for cover. \"It was just so loud, and then it was silence,\" said witness Jennifer Kramer, who hid inside a circular clothing rack. \"I was scared to death he'd be walking around looking for someone else.\" Watch how Kramer and her mother hid » .\n\nA friend of Hawkins' said he hadn't thought Hawkins was capable of such violence. \"He was the one guy, you know, if people would be getting in a fight he'd be trying to break it up,\" said Shawn Saunders, who had known Hawkins for about 2½ years. \"If there were arguments amongst our friends or groups, he was kind of like the calm, cool and collected one.\" Watch how Saunders learned Hawkins was the shooter » .\n\nDave Heineman said Hawkins had been a ward of the state for nearly four years, but he did not specify in what capacity.\n\nThe state's custody ended in August of last year, Heineman said.\n\nArmy recruiters turned Hawkins down last summer when he tried to enlist, a source familiar with the situation said Thursday.\n\nThe source didn't want to be named because it is against the military's rules to discuss potential recruits.\n\nHeineman ordered that flags throughout the state be lowered to half-staff through Sunday.\n\nThe dead include six store employees and two customers, ranging in age from 24 to 66.\n\nOne store employee was in critical but stable condition Thursday and another had been upgraded from critical to serious, according to hospital officials.\n\nAnother person was still being treated Thursday afternoon, Warren said, but he did not specify whether the individual was a customer or employee.\n\nTwo other customers had been treated and released, he said.\n\nWestroads Mall remained closed Thursday, but the facility, including the Von Maur store, could reopen Friday.",

    "text": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A six-month trial was launched this week that promises to transform the way luggage is tracked and monitored at London's Heathrow airport.\n\nAs many as 28 in every 1,000 passengers do not arrive at their destination at the same time as their luggage.\n\nThe trial -- run by BAA and airline Emirates -- is using RFID (radio-frequency identification) technology to tag baggage.\n\nThis will allow staff to more accurately track bags passing through the airport.\n\nThe crucial difference between RFID and the existing barcode system is its scanning accuracy.\n\nBarcode tags can be easily damaged in transit and are also at risk of being covered when scanned.\n\nIf not scanned, details must be entered manually into the system, adding time and error to the process.\n\nBAA estimates that Heathrow can read only 60 per cent of labels that pass through.\n\nRFID is reported to offer over 99 percent accuracy.\n\nThe £150,000 trial -- the first of its kind in the UK -- will continue for six months tracking bags for passengers traveling with Emirates to and from Dubai, and transferring through Heathrow.\n\nA duplicate of the Heathrow system has been installed at Dubai Airport.\n\nDuring the check-in process at Heathrow Terminal 3, staff apply tags containing RFID chips to bags with information including the passenger's name and route.\n\nThe chips are then read on entry into the baggage system; they are tracked as they move throughout; and finally on leaving the system.\n\nAs a result, says Shaun Cowlam, Logistics Director at Heathrow Airport, staff can know where a bag is at \"every moment of every day\".\n\nBAA is also considering introducing a SMS text messaging service to keep passengers informed of where their bags are.\n\nWhen passengers arrive at Heathrow, says Cowlam, the idea will be to send passengers a text informing them what belt and what time their bags will arrive at.\n\nUltimately, the use of RFID could extend services to frequent flyers, and provide the means to added value services such as faster check-in, and even be integrated with secure collection and delivery.\n\nThe main benefits, however, will be for travelers passing through major hubs such as Heathrow and Dubai, as this system offers better processing of baggage on transfer flights.\n\nEmirates and BAA are sharing the costs of the trial.\n\nBut as Vic Sheppard, Emirates Vice President for UK and Ireland says, \"cost is not an issue\", especially considering the savings the airline is expected to achieve by reducing loss and repatriation of bags.\n\nAnd as Cowlam adds: \"if we can introduce this across the whole network the costs will reduce significantly.\" Hong Kong International Airport was one of the first to deploy RFID technology in 2005.\n\nBut as outlined in a recent survey by SITA, RFID is being used in just 6 percent of the airports surveyed. \"For this system to really take off we need other airports and other airlines to embrace the technology,\" says Cowlam.\n\nThat widespread adoption may not be far off.\n\nThe SITA survey indicated that RFID tags will be used in 45 percent of airports by the end of 2009.\n\nIt's still early days, but BAA and Emirates are optimistic for RFID's future in airports. \"There have been giant strides in the technology in aviation in recent years.\n\nBut in the last few decades there hasn't been any advancement in the methods adopted for baggage handling,\" says Sheppard. \"This is a major step forward.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "title": "Telegram: King Hussein wanted U.S. strike on invading Syrian troops in 1970 .",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Jordan's King Hussein sent a secret message to President Richard Nixon in 1970 pleading with him to attack Syria, according to declassified documents released Wednesday by the former president's library.\n\nPresident Nixon works at his desk in the Oval Office in a June 1972 photograph.\n\nThe papers are among about 10,000 documents released by the Nixon Presidential Library, some of which offer harbingers of present-day events, such as concerns about terrorism and Saudi Arabia.\n\nLibrary director Timothy Naftali said the documents describe challenges such as how to get the Saudis more involved in solving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, how to get them more engaged against terrorism, how to address the Arab view that the United States always sides with Israel and how to build up moderate Palestinians to counter extremists.\n\nA 1973 diplomatic cable cites this objective: \"isolate and undermine terrorisms [sic] and commandos [sic] by establishing another, more stable and respectable Palestinian political entity and political personality.\" Documents detail U.S. efforts to persuade Saudi Arabia to move away from Fatah, the military wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization, because U.S. officials believed the PLO was supporting the terrorist-linked, anti-Israel group Black September, referred to as BSO.\n\nState Department telegram from the embassy in Jeddah to Washington reads, \"BSO and Fatah [are] now linked together in vicious effort to create chaos and uncertainty.\n\nOne might wonder whether central objective BSO conspiracy was not to erase any slight progress toward Middle East peace.\" The document release was intended to coincide with Mideast peace summit among Palestinian, Israeli and other Mideast leaders in Maryland, Naftali said.\n\nThe Nixon White House also was adjusting to Israel's acquisition of a nuclear weapon. \"We are declassifying the records today that laid the basis for Richard Nixon's decision in 1969 to accept the fact, a fact of life, that Israel had a bomb, a nuclear device,\" said Naftali. \"That, of course, is very important with what's going on in Annapolis.\" \"Even though it is clear from the documents that the United States government did not encourage Israel to acquire a nuclear deterrent, it became a fact of life,\" Naftali said. \"There are materials here that show how our government, 30 years ago, dealt with this very, very difficult problem.\" Rather than openly declare itself as a nuclear power, Israel still maintains a strategic ambiguity over its nuclear weapons capability.\n\nIn 1970, as King Hussein dealt with threats by both Palestinian refugees in his country and Syrian military forces crossing Jordan's border, the king asked \"the United States and Great Britain to intervene in the war in Jordan, asking the United States, in fact, to attack Syria,\" Naftali said. \"Syria had invaded Jordan and the Jordanian king, facing what he felt was a military rout, said please help us in any way possible.\" The telegram indicates that Hussein himself called a U.S. official at 3 a.m. to ask for American or British help. \"Situation deteriorating dangerously following Syrian massive invasion...,\" the document said. \"I request immediate physical intervention both land and air ... to safeguard sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Jordan.\n\nImmediate air strikes on invading forces from any quarter plus air cover are imperative.\" The library has withheld the Nixon documents from public access until Wednesday and have been reviewed for release and/or declassified, Naftali said.\n\nNixon served as president from January 20, 1969, to August 9, 1974, when he resigned under political pressure during the Watergate scandal -- the only U.S. president to do so.\n\nHe died in 1994 after suffering a stroke at the age of 81.",

    "text": "James Orange, a civil rights activist whose 1965 jailing sparked a fatal protest that ultimately led to the famed Selma-to-Montgomery march and the Voting Rights Act, died Saturday at Atlanta's Crawford Long Hospital, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference said in a statement.\n\nOrange was a native of Birmingham, Alabama, \"who resided in southwest Atlanta for four decades while fighting the good fight for equality and social justice for all mankind,\" said the SCLC, a civil rights organization.\n\nOrange was arrested and jailed in Perry County, Alabama, in 1965 on charges of disorderly conduct and contributing to the delinquency of minors for enlisting students to aid in voting rights drives.\n\nAs rumors spread that Orange would be lynched, civil rights activists organized a march to support him.\n\nHowever, the marchers clashed with Alabama state troopers during the February 18 demonstration, and a young black man, Jimmie Lee Jackson, was shot in the stomach. \"I could hear the singing and the commotion,\" Orange told CNN last year. \"Once the tear gas was flying and the shots started, I couldn't tell what was going on.\" Jackson, 26, died eight days later.\n\nWitnesses said Jackson's grandfather, who was active in the voting rights movement, had been beaten by troopers, and Jackson was trying to get him to the hospital.\n\nThe anger resulting from Jackson's death led civil rights leaders, including the Rev.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr., to organize the Selma-to-Montgomery, Alabama, voting rights march.\n\nThe first attempt at that march was broken up by club-wielding state troopers and sheriff's deputies, a melee that became known as \"Bloody Sunday.\" \"Jimmie's death is the reason that Bloody Sunday took place,\" Orange said. \"Had he not died, there would never have been a Bloody Sunday.\" On the marchers' third attempt, in March, they made it to Montgomery.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law in August 1965.\n\nIn May 2007, a former Alabama state trooper, James B.\n\nFowler, now 74, was indicted in Jackson's shooting, one of several cases involving the deaths of civil rights activists that prosecutors have revived in recent years.\n\nFowler has claimed he shot Jackson in self-defense, but Orange and Elijah Rollins, who was upstairs at a nearby cafe when the shooting took place, last year disputed claims that protesters were throwing rocks and bottles at police. \"Not one bottle or brick was thrown back at the troopers,\" said Orange, adding that film and a Justice Department report back that up.\n\nHe said he was glad Jackson's case had \"never been forgotten.\" Orange was a project coordinator at the SCLC from 1965 to 1970, then later became a regional coordinator with the AFL-CIO in Atlanta, the SCLC said.\n\nSince 1995, he had served as the founder and general coordinator for the M.L.\n\nMarch Committee-Africa/African American Renaissance Committee, Inc., which coordinated commemorative events honoring King and also promoted industry and commerce among Atlanta, the United States and South Africa.\n\nOrange is survived by his wife, five children and two grandchildren, the SCLC said.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The CIA asked the Justice Department to investigate whether former operative John Kiriakou illegally disclosed classified information when he talked about the waterboarding of a terrorism suspect, government officials say.\n\nEx-CIA agent John Kiriakou says he underwent waterboarding in training and cracked in a few seconds.\n\nKiriakou spoke last week with several news organizations, including CNN, after the CIA disclosed that videotapes of certain interrogations were destroyed in 2005.\n\nThat revelation has prompted new calls for investigations on Capitol Hill.\n\nDistrict Court on Friday to answer a judge's questions about the tapes' destruction.\n\nSpeaking to CNN last week, Kiriakou said that U.S. interrogators drew valuable information from al Qaeda captive Abu Zubayda by \"waterboarding\" him.\n\nBut Kiriakou said the procedure amounts to torture and should be stopped.\n\nWaterboarding involves pouring a stream of water onto the cellophane-covered face of a suspect to induce the sensation of drowning, Kiriakou said.\n\nKiriakou told CNN he was unaware that CIA interrogations were being taped, but that the tapes should have been kept \"as a matter of historical record.\" Kiriakou's attorney Mark Zaid told CNN that the referral of the case to the Justice Department is standard procedure. \"A criminal referral from the CIA would be both expected and normal under the circumstances,\" Zaid said in a written statement. \"It is a routine act that the CIA undertakes even when they know no violation has occurred.\" Zaid added that the question is whether the Justice Department will proceed, and that such a decision \"must be measured carefully.\" \"Doing so will unlock a Pandora's box that will place a spotlight on the information in question as to the lawfulness of the alleged conduct and the activities of those involved.\" he said. \"There would also exist a challenge regarding whether Mr.\n\nKiriakou was being targeted for exercising his First Amendment rights.\" CIA officers who leave the agency are required to sign documents promising never to divulge classified information.\n\nWritten comments are cleared by an agency review board before publication, and unscripted oral comments -- such as television interviews -- are referred to the Justice Department after the fact.\n\nAbout one case a week is referred to the Justice Department, and an investigation could take months to complete, a source in the intelligence community said.\n\nFor private citizens found to be in violation of the secrecy standard, penalties can range from loss of security clearances to criminal prosecution leading to jail time.\n\nJustice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said the department has no comment on the Kiriakou matter, and routinely refuses comment on whether another agency has referred a case.\n\nKiriakou said he was not present when other agents used the waterboarding technique on Abu Zubayda, but that he was told the al Qaeda suspect lasted 30 or 35 seconds.\n\nKiriakou said he himself was subjected to the treatment during his training, and lasted about five seconds before having to stop.",

    "title": "Woman remembers one Valentine's Day as \"Black Monday\"",
    "text": "(LifeWire) -- For some, Valentine's Day can be heavenly.\n\nFour years ago, she and her live-in boyfriend -- the guy she thought she would marry -- were having a pre-Valentine's Day brunch when Sullivan leaned over and whispered a few sweet nothings in his ear. \"I said, 'I'm so happy to know that you're the one for me.\n\nAren't you glad to know I'm the one for you?' \" says Sullivan, 32, who works in marketing. \"And there was this silence.\n\nAnd then he was, like, 'I know you're the one for me now.\n\nBut can you give me until summer to make a final decision?' \" Aghast at his response, Sullivan quickly broke things off -- but she couldn't move until she found a new apartment.\n\nHome alone on February 14 in the apartment they shared, she decided to snoop through her ex-boyfriend's e-mail and discovered he'd had contact with several other women while they were together. \"I've never been a big fan of the holiday,\" Sullivan says. \"But now I typically refer to it as Black Monday...\" Watch whether romance is still alive » .\n\nThanks to super-sized expectations and over-the-top commercialization, February 14 has gone from a sentimental aside to a pressure-filled gauntlet lined with chocolate boxes, tennis bracelets and cheesy stuffed bears.\n\nSee where the love dollars go » . \"The holiday's designed to make you feel (bad),\" says Judy McGuire, author of \"How Not to Date.\" \"If you're in a relationship, it's never anything that it's supposed to be.\n\nAnd if you're single, you feel like a big loser because you don't have anybody.\n\nI think people should lower Valentine's Day expectations to pretty much nil.\n\nThat way, anything that happens is good.\" Brian Wise, a 32-year-old technical writer from Seattle has seen his Valentine's Day go sideways repeatedly -- most memorably the time he ended up in handcuffs (and not in a good way). \"Last year, I was in Singapore and I met this beautiful woman who took me to dinner at this hot, new restaurant,'\" he says. \"But then she gets food poisoning and ends up in an alley with major gastrointestinal problems.\n\nAnd while I'm standing guard, the cops pull up and think I'm paying her for sex.\" Wise talked his way out of an arrest (luckily, one of the policemen had eaten at the same place) but he's found no release from his unlucky Valentine's. \"It doesn't matter who I'm out with,\" he says. \"The day is just cursed.\" There are ways, though, to avoid a miserable holiday.\n\nMost women will admit they like to celebrate, but a fancy night on the town isn't necessary. \"Sometimes, hanging out at home can be a lot more fun than going out to some restaurant filled with couples,\" says author McGuire. \"Stay home with champagne, caviar and maybe a new toy from a tasteful sex shop.\" If you're not dating anyone, take some time to indulge yourself (a luxurious bar of chocolate, a pedicure), do something relaxing (take a yoga class or get a massage) or spend time with some of your closest friends.\n\nAnd if you do make plans, stick to them.\n\nGalen, a 28-year-old secretary from Seattle, and her boyfriend had made special Valentine's Day plans a month in advance.\n\nBut on the big night, his buddies showed up and talked him into going out with them instead. \"I was dressed to the nines,\" says Galen, who asked that her last name not be used. \"When his friends stopped by, he says, 'Do you mind if I go with them?' I said, 'Fine, go,' being totally sarcastic, and he picked up his coat and left.\" Although they talked about it later, Galen said, her boyfriend seemed not to understand that she was unhappy with his wanting to ditch her for his buddies.\n\nBreaking a date on Valentine's Day is definitely bad form, but automatically expecting one to happen (a much more common scenario) is also problematic.\n\nTo avoid a disconnect with your significant other, McGuire suggests being honest.\n\nSimply expecting your partner to know what you want is unrealistic.\n\nIf you decide to go the gift route, McGuire recommends not settling for a cliché like a stuffed animal or a hastily purchased bouquet of flowers. \"Listen to what the person talks about,\" she says. \"She may want the new 'Godzilla' game for her Wii.\n\nHis underwear may be riddled with holes.\" Another thing to avoid, advises Katie Briggs, 44, of Seattle, is the gag gift.\n\nA few years ago, Briggs and a new beau went out to a nice restaurant where they shared dinner, drinks and presents.\n\nBriggs gave her date homemade cookies and a Starbucks gift card.\n\nHe gave her a beautifully-wrapped box -- of Spam. \"He thought it was the best joke ever,\" says Briggs. \"But it just wasn't thoughtful.\n\nIf you're going to go with a joke, you need to back it up with something else.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nLifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers.\n\nDiane Mapes is the author of \"How to Date in a Post-Dating World.\" Her column, \"Single Shot,\" appears in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.",

    "title": "Judge: Lisa Nowak's statements and items in her car were unlawfully obtained .",
    "text": "(CNN) -- A Florida judge Friday handed a legal victory to a former astronaut accused of assaulting a romantic rival, ruling evidence found in her car and statements she made to police after her arrest were inadmissible at trial.\n\nLisa Nowak, accused of using pepper spray against a romantic rival, is set to go on trial in April.\n\nNinth Judicial Circuit Judge Marc Lubet ruled that all were unlawfully obtained.\n\nHe said his decision stemmed from a variety of factors, most concerning police tactics in their interview of Lisa Nowak and the fact that no written consent was obtained to search her car. \"In each and every case, this court must ensure that the constitutional protections afforded by our forefathers are scrupulously honored,\" Lubet wrote in his opinion. \"Unfortunately, in this case those protections were not as thoroughly followed as the law demands.\" Nowak, 44, is accused of stalking Air Force Capt.\n\nColleen Shipman and using pepper spray against her in a parking lot at Orlando International Airport in Florida on February 5.\n\nShe pleaded not guilty March 22 to charges of attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm, battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon.\n\nIf convicted, she would face a sentence of up to life in prison.\n\nHer defense attorneys had claimed Nowak's comments to police and her consent to search her car were made under duress.\n\nDuring a hearing held in August, Lubet heard testimony from, among others, Nowak, Shipman and Orlando police detective William Becton, who interviewed Nowak after her arrest.\n\nLubet said in his ruling that when Nowak asked Becton if she needed an attorney during the interview, he failed to answer her question in a \"simple and straightforward manner.\" \"There was a concerted effort to minimize and downplay the significance of the Miranda rights by referring to these constitutional rights as 'formalities' \" during the interview, Lubet wrote.\n\nOn the audiotape of the interview, there was no audible response from Nowak on whether she understood that her statements could be used against her in court, and when she was asked whether anyone had threatened or promised her anything to get her to talk to police, Lubet wrote. \"Thus, there is nothing in either the audio recording or the transcript of the interview that demonstrates that defendant understood these two rights and waived them.\" Nowak testified at the August hearing she did not respond to Becton's questions because she was confused, Lubet wrote.\n\nIn addition, he said, Becton used \"legally impermissible\" statements and techniques, including threats, to get Nowak's statements and consent. \"Well, what you say can change what you're charged with,\" Becton said at one point. \"Right now we're looking at [a] possible life felony of carjacking.\" In a written statement, an Orlando Police Department spokeswoman said it was inappropriate for the department to comment on the case since it is pending in court, and referred questions to prosecutors.\n\nLubet noted that, although Nowak was given the opportunity to use the restroom and was asked if she wanted something to eat, she was \"subjected to a barrage of questions\" beginning in the predawn hours and was questioned for six hours without being given the opportunity to sleep or make a phone call. \"Defendant had not slept during the preceding 24 hours,\" the judge said.\n\nNowak's consent to search her car, Lubet wrote, \"followed illegal police activity, such as a prolonged detention, threats to obtain a warrant and repeated requests for consent.\" Prosecutors accuse Nowak of driving nearly 900 miles from Houston to Orlando -- wearing NASA diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and donning a disguise before following Shipman from baggage claim to a parking lot.\n\nHer attorney has strongly denied that she wore the diapers.\n\nShipman told police that after she got into her car, Nowak feigned distress and knocked on the window.\n\nWhen Shipman cracked it to talk to her, Nowak sprayed her in the face with pepper spray, Shipman said.\n\nPolice said Nowak was detained as she was disposing of her disguise in an airport trash bin.\n\nNowak has said she merely went to the airport to talk to Shipman, who had begun dating Nowak's former love interest, Navy Cmdr.\n\nBill Oefelein, who was also an astronaut but has since left the astronaut corps.\n\nAt the August hearing, Becton testified that when he searched Nowak's car, he found maps showing how to reach the airport, maps of the airport's layout, a buck knife and papers including a letter Nowak appeared to have written to Oefelein's mother.\n\nHe also testified he found used and clean diapers in the car.\n\nPolice previously said they also found a BB gun, a steel mallet, a 4-inch knife and rubber tubing in the vehicle.\n\nNowak's attorneys in August filed a notice of intent to rely on an insanity defense, saying in court documents her diagnoses include a litany of more than a dozen psychiatric disorders.\n\nOn August 30, Lubet granted Nowak's attorneys' request that her electronic tracking ankle bracelet be removed.",

    "text": "MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Sharon Long's work has earned her the nickname \"Skull Lady.\" Sharon Long is a forensic artist whose job is to help identify the dead, often murder victims.\n\nShe is a forensic artist whose job is to give faces -- and sometimes identities -- back to anonymous murder victims who have been robbed of both.\n\nArmed with sculptor's clay, glass eyes, wigs and research, Long creates a face from a human skull.\n\nWhen Fort Myers, Florida, police found eight sets of human remains in the woods in March, they turned to her -- anything to help identify the people who were so mercilessly left to rot amid the trees and mud. \"[Police] have no other way.\n\nThey have no fingerprints; they have no flesh.\n\nUsually, the last resort is building a face,\" Long said.\n\nShe hopes that when the faces of those killed get printed in newspapers or appear on TV or online, a friend or loved one recognizes them and says, \"Gee, we haven't seen so-and-so for a while, and that kind of looks like him.\" \"Then, at least, you have a lead, and then you can get DNA from people.\n\nAnd then [police] have something to go on.\" Long, 67, has made faces for the unknown victims of grisly homicides and solved historical mysteries.\n\nDuring her 20-year career, the forensics specialist from the University of Wyoming helped identify the crew of the H.L Hunley, a Confederate submarine sunk during the Civil War.\n\nShe also created the first picture of the only explorer to have died on the Lewis and Clark expedition.\n\nWhen law enforcement asks for Long's assistance, it is almost always on a case that has gone very cold.\n\nAnd that was exactly the case in Fort Myers, where police were desperate for any information on the dead they found: eight men killed, their bodies discovered in a wooded area on March 23, 2007.\n\nWatch how bones can give clues to investigators » .\n\nThere were no witnesses, no leads and little evidence of killings other than the victims' bones.\n\nIf Long could identify the victims of the crime, it might help to catch a serial killer.\n\nBut before Long could create any likeness of the victims, she would have to do a lot of work -- hundreds of hours of it.\n\nLong first creates a mold of the skull and uses it to make a plaster replica.\n\nShe puts eraser tips on points to mark tissue depth.\n\nSculptor's clay fills in for skin and muscle.\n\nThe faded gumline on the skull's teeth helps Long determine how thick the person's lips were.\n\nThe victim's hair and eye color requires guesswork and research, Long says.\n\nOften while working on cases, she talks to people who lived in the same area as the victim or victims to find out the most common eye color and what hairstyles are in fashion.\n\nShe spent two months on the Fort Myers skulls. \"I start working, and 15 hours can go by, and I don't get up and move, and you don't realize how much time has gone by, and, well, that's how intense I get,\" she said. \"It's like you get carried away in this life of somebody.\n\nI start trying to think of them as being an alive person and doing something and not getting killed.\" Eventually, publicity about the Fort Myers case would lead people with missing relatives to submit their DNA.\n\nTesting revealed that two of the men were Erik Kohler and John Blevins.\n\nBoth men lived hardscrabble lives and had run-ins with police.\n\nAt a news conference last month where Fort Myers police unveiled Long's sculptures, investigators said they still need to identify the other six victims if they are to solve the case.\n\nKohler and Blevins didn't closely mirror Long's sculptures of their faces, but there were some similarities, some facial features that looked liked the two dead men.\n\nAnd that's what police say they want: They hope people with missing relatives will look at every detail of the other six sculptures to see whether they notice any resemblance, no matter how faint. \"Going into this, I knew there would be some level of subjectivity in the art part of it, but I think what it does is generate the interest,\" Fort Myers Police Detective Barry Lewis said. \"I am just looking for that one little similarity, that one little key that someone could recognize that they could make a call that that is their loved one.\" Since the news conference, police say, they have received hundreds of leads.\n\nLong's work on the case might be done, but she still has nightmares about the eight men killed. \"I hear screaming, and I hear pleading, and I hear all these things which I couldn't imagine,\" she said. \"I can see somebody dragging a body out there, and here he kept taking them to the same area.\n\nI think, what in the hell is wrong with this guy?\" Six of those killed remain nameless.\n\nAnd police are still trying to find the killer.\n\nAuthorities urge anyone with more information on the case to call 877-667-1296.",

    "text": "(CNN) -- German zookeepers in Nuremberg will bottle-feed a four-week-old polar bear and rear it away from its mother after concerns the mother would eat her cub, officials said Thursday.\n\nZookeepers fear the unnamed polar bear cub could be at risk of being eaten.\n\nThe cub, which doesn't yet have a name, was being cared for at Nuremberg City Zoo, where it was resting under heat lamps and is drinking formula. \"It's gaining weight, it's very hungry, it drinks a lot of milk,\" said Alexandra Foghammar, a spokeswoman for the city.\n\nThe zoo announced Thursday that the cub is female.\n\nWednesday, the zoo said keepers decided to take the cub away from its mother, Vera, because the mother was showing signs of being upset and confused, taking her baby in and out of the animals' enclosure. \"We were 100 percent sure that the baby was going to die if we didn't take it away from her,\" Nuremberg zoo director Dag Encke told Time magazine. \"This would have been a death verdict for the cub.\" The zoo confirmed earlier this week that its other female polar bear, Vilma, had eaten her two offspring.\n\nThe zoo said it feared Vera would do the same, so it took her cub away as a precaution.\n\nSince then, the cub is thriving in the care of humans, but Vera seems to miss her cub, Foghammar said.\n\nWatch how zoo has faced criticism over polar bears. » . \"The mother is a little bit nervous,\" she said. \"She walks around and is searching for the baby, but the responsible persons for the zoo say this is normal.\n\nIt will continue for three or four days.\n\nIt's a normal situation.\" The zookeepers are pondering whether to bring another adult bear, possibly the cub's father, Felix, to the zoo to help Vera overcome her loss, and are seeking another small bear to serve as a companion for the rescued cub, Time reported.\n\nThe zoo said a keeper entered Vilma's enclosure Monday and noticed that her two cubs were nowhere to be found.\n\nThe zoo said it assumes Vilma ate her young because she believed the cubs were sick, though zookeepers say the cubs were last seen on Sunday and appeared in good health.\n\nBut Foghammar told Time that the separation of the bears was bad for the \"principle of wildlife conservation\" at the zoo: \"Now the cub will not grow up to act in a natural way, just as the mother lacked the experience to bring up a cub.\" The plight of the cub follows the case last year of Knut, a cub rejected by its mother at Berlin Zoo who became the focus of a media frenzy after animal rights campaigners called for it to be killed, claiming it had become too dependent on humans.",

County Sheriff's Office.\n\nPolice believe 2-year-old Riley Ann Sawyers is \"Baby Grace.\" The affidavit says the girl's mother, Kimberly Dawn Trenor, described to police how her daughter died and was put in a plastic storage box that Trenor and her husband, Royce Zeigler, later dumped into a Galveston waterway.\n\nTrenor told police Zeigler tried to commit suicide the weekend before Thanksgiving,

years.\n\nPolice dubbed the child \"Baby Grace.\" A police artist's sketch of her was widely circulated in the news media and prompted a call to Galveston police from Riley's grandmother in Ohio, who had not seen the girl in months.\n\nOn Saturday, police arrested Trenor and Zeigler on charges of injuring a child and tampering with physical evidence, the sheriff's department said.\n\nThe affidavit, obtained by CNN, says when police interviewed Trenor on November 23, she \"gave a voluntary statement on video with her attorney present in which she describes her involvement, with Royce Zeigler, in the physical abuse, death and disposal of the remains of her daughter, Riley Ann Sawyers.\" Trenor's statement said on July 24, she and Zeigler both beat the child with leather belts and held her head under water in the bathtub.\n\nShe said Zeigler picked the girl up by her hair and also threw her across the room, slamming her head into the tile floor.\n\nAfter her daughter died, Trenor's statement said, she and Zeigler went to a Wal-Mart that night and bought the Sterilite container, a shovel, concrete mix, and other supplies.\n\nThe statement said the box containing the child's body was hidden in a storage shed for \"one to two months.\" Then, Trenor said, she and Zeigler carried it to the Galveston Causeway and tossed it in, and she saw it drifting away.\n\nRiley

Department said Monday that authorities are \"fairly confident\" that the toddler whose body was found on October 29 is Riley Ann Sawyers.\n\nDNA analysis is still in progress to confirm the identification.\n\nThe results will be available in two to three weeks, Tuttoilmondo said.\n\nTuttoilmondo said Riley is originally from Mentor, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb, and that \"she and her mother came down to Texas earlier this year.\" The toddler was last seen in Texas \"three or four months ago,\" Tuttoilmondo said, although he did not know by whom.\n\nTuttoilmondo said police did investigate whether Child Protective Services had taken Riley away, something the mother had reportedly alleged.\n\nOf that report, Tuttoilmondo said, \"What we believe is that is not what happened.\" The affidavit said Trenor admitted that after the body was found, Zeigler had her type up a fake letter from the Ohio Department of Children's Services saying that Riley was to be taken away.\n\nTrenor left Ohio in late May, after filing an allegation of domestic violence against Robert Sawyers and reaching a joint voluntary agreement that gave her custody of Riley and gave Robert Sawyers visitation rights, the Sawyers' family lawyer said Monday. \"She disappeared,\" Laura DePledge said Monday at the Ohio news conference with the Sawyers.\n\nSheryl Sawyers said Monday that she saw widely distributed police sketches of \"Baby Grace\" and contacted Galveston police in November.\n\nThe girl in the police sketches strongly resembles photos of Riley. \"No, I never did think it would end up like this,\" Sheryl Sawyers said Monday, eyes welling. \"I guess knowing is better than not knowing.\" The girl's family in Ohio has been \"very helpful\" in this case, Tuttoilmondo said, adding that the FBI and a Galveston County police officer visited the family in Ohio on Sunday.\n\nDePledge said Riley was the product of a \"teenage pregnancy.\" Trenor and Robert Sawyers were together for two years as a result of the pregnancy, DePledge said, during which time they lived with Sheryl Sawyers.\n\nDePledge said Monday that the family, whose grief she described as \"simply overwhelming,\" wants Riley's body returned to Ohio for a memorial service. \"What Riley needs is to be brought home,\" she said. \"I think this family needs some closure.\" Tuttoilmondo asked anyone who knew the child or her family to help detectives reconstruct the events of Riley's short life.\n\nThe toddler's case has touched even hardened police officers, he said. \"Any way you look at it, we carry a piece of her with us, and we'll always carry a little piece of her with us,\" he said Monday.\n\nHe held up a small, pink-and-white shoe identical to those the child was wearing when she was found. \"That says it all.\n\nA little-bitty shoe.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "text": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Topps Meat Co. on Saturday expanded a recall of ground beef from about 300,000 pounds to 21.7 million pounds, one of the largest meat recalls in U.S. history.\n\nThe recalled products are all ground beef patties with various brand names.\n\nIn a statement, the Elizabeth, New Jersey, company said the hamburger patties may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, a bacterium that can cause severe diarrhea and cramps, as well as other complications.\n\nDepartment of Agriculture said 25 illnesses are under investigation in Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Maine, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe ground beef products being recalled have a \"sell by date\" or a \"best if used by date\" between September 25, 2007, and September 25, 2008, Topps' statement said.\n\nThe packages also have the marking \"Est. 9748\" inside the USDA mark of inspection.\n\nTuesday, the company announced a recall of about 331,000 pounds of hamburger meat, according to the USDA. \"Because the health and safety of our consumers is our top priority, we are taking these expansive measures,\" said Vice President of Operations Geoffrey Livermore in the statement. \"Topps is continuing to work with the USDA, state departments of health, retailers and distributors to ensure the safety of our consumers.\n\nAdditionally, we have augmented our internal quality control procedures with microbiologists and food safety experts.\n\nWe sincerely regret any inconvenience and concerns this may cause our consumers,\" Livermore said.\n\nThis is the company's first recall in its 65 years of business, the statement said.\n\nConsumers who find the products at home are asked to cut off the UPC code and return it to Topps for a full refund, then dispose of the product immediately, Topps spokeswoman Michelle Williams said.\n\nThe company said to avoid E. coli, consumers should wash hands thoroughly after handling the beef.\n\nTopps set up a toll-free recall help line at (888) 734-0451.\n\nWilliams said because the products may have been produced up to a year ago, many of them have already been safely consumed.\n\nProduction in the ground beef area of the company's plant in Elizabeth has been shut down until all the investigations are complete, Williams said in a phone interview. \"We're working with the USDA and the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and conducting our own investigation,\" she added.\n\nThe products, all ground beef patties and hamburgers with various brand names, were distributed mainly in the northeastern United States, but went to retailers in many other areas of the country as well, Williams said.\n\nWhile the sheer size of the recall is large, two other companies have been involved in larger recalls.\n\nIn 2002, Pilgrim's Pride recalled more than 27 million pounds of poultry, and Hudson Foods recalled 25 million pounds of ground beef in 1997.",

    "text": "Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running a tight race in Texas.\n\nA new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll suggests the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination between Sens.\n\nHillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois is a statistical dead heat in Texas, which holds primaries March 4.\n\nIn the survey, out Monday, 50 percent of likely Democratic primary voters support Clinton as their choice for the party's nominee, with 48 percent backing Obama.\n\nBut taking into account the poll's sampling error of plus or minus 4½ percentage points for Democratic respondents, the race is a virtual tie.\n\nTwo recent polls by other organizations also show the race statistically even.\n\nMap: National and state polling . \"One reason the race appears to be tight is that Texas Democrats are having a hard time choosing between two attractive options,\" says CNN polling director Keating Holland. \"Likely Democratic primary voters would be equally happy if either candidate won the nomination, and they don't see a lot of difference between them on several top issues. \"Roughly a quarter of likely voters say they could change their minds in the next two weeks -- and not surprisingly, those people are splitting roughly equally between Clinton and Obama.\" Many political strategists and analysts consider Texas and Ohio -- which also holds a March 4 primary -- must-win states for Clinton.\n\nObama has won the past eight contests and is now ahead in the overall battle for delegates, 193 of which are at stake in Texas.\n\nJohn McCain is the clear favorite for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nAmong Republicans, 55 percent of likely Texas GOP primary voters support McCain as their choice for nominee.\n\nMike Huckabee and 11 percent support home-state congressman and former Libertarian standard-bearer Ron Paul.\n\nThe poll's sampling error for Republican respondents is 4 percentage points.\n\nThe CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted by telephone from Friday through Sunday.\n\nPollsters talked to 1,506 adults in Texas, including 553 likely Republican primary voters and 529 likely Democratic primary voters.\n\nMcCain is the overwhelming front-runner in the fight for the Republican presidential nomination and party leaders have rallied around the candidate in an attempt for party unity.\n\nThe poll was released on the same day the only living former Republican president -- George Herbert Walker Bush, the current president's father -- endorsed McCain at an event in Houston.\n\nBut McCain has had trouble winning conservative voters.\n\nJust last week, McCain lost the conservative vote to Huckabee in the Virginia primary, according to exit polls.\n\nThe new survey, though, suggests McCain may have better luck in Texas. \"It looks like McCain has made some inroads with conservative Republicans,\" Holland said. \"McCain is picking up a bare majority among conservative likely voters in the GOP primary.\n\nThe McCain campaign probably wishes that number were higher, but it does mean that a McCain victory in Texas would not be based on the votes of moderates and independents, as has happened in several states in the past few weeks.\" Texas Democrats and Republicans may not see eye to eye on the issues, but the poll suggests they do agree on what's the most important issue.\n\nThirty-five percent of Democrats and an equal number of Republicans said the economy was the most important issue in their choice for president.\n\nThe second most important issue for Democrats was health care, at 23 percent, followed by the war in Iraq at 22 percent, illegal immigration at 10 percent and terrorism at 7 percent.\n\nNineteen percent of Republicans said illegal immigration was their most important issue, putting it in second place, followed by the war in Iraq and terrorism at 17 percent and health care at 8 percent.\n\nSixty percent of Republicans say they'll definitely support the candidate they are now backing.\n\nThat number climbs to 76 percent for Democrats.\n\nLikely Democratic primary voters view Clinton and Obama on roughly equal terms.\n\nSeventy-nine percent say they would be satisfied if Clinton were the nominee; an equal number feel the same way about Obama.\n\nSeventy-nine percent say it's likely Clinton can win the nomination; 82 percent say the same about Obama.\n\nThe two candidates are essentially tied on immigration, Iraq and the economy, but Clinton has an advantage on health care and abortion.",

    "text": "(CNN) -- Despite the obvious claims of younger rivals Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, few can really argue with the 96 football journalists who voted Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite as the 2007 World Footballer of the Year.\n\nBrazilian genius Kaka fully deserves winning the 2007 World Footballer of the Year award.\n\nThe prestigious Ballon d'Or award is widely regarded as the most prestigious individual prize in football and Kaka's inclusion on its coveted roll of honor is a testament to the 25-year-old Brazilian's current standing in world football.\n\nWhen AC Milan defeated Liverpool in the Champions League final in Athens, avenging their heartbreaking loss to the same team in Istanbul two years previously, it enabled Kaka to fulfill his dream of holding aloft Europe's premier trophy -- a winner's medal he fully deserved after a sublime 90-minute performance.\n\nKaka's stock for both club and country has risen steadily since his move to the San Siro from Sao Paulo for a fee of just $8.5 million in the summer of 2003.\n\nUnlike many a Brazilian sporting genius, Kaka did not hone his skills on the beach or the streets of a favela shanty town.\n\nHe was born into a comfortable middle class Brasilia family, where football was not the only hope of a bright future.\n\nHowever, it soon became clear that this particular boy had a very special skill and he was signed by Sao Paulo, after his family had moved there, at just eight years of age -- making his first team debut as an 18-year-old.\n\nKaka's progress was soon picked up by his national team coach and Felipe Scolari named the graceful midfielder in his 23-man squad for the 2002 World Cup finals, earning him a winners' medal despite playing only 19 minutes of the tournament in a group match against Costa Rica.\n\nA year later, and Kaka was on his way to Milan.\n\nWithin a month he had made the starting line-up and his 10 goals helped the Rossoneri lift the Scudetto and the European Super Cup.\n\nThroughout his career, Kaka has always possessed the innate ability to score goals -- his record for both club and country sees him average roughly a goal every three games.\n\nYet to describe Kaka merely as a goalscoring midfielder would be doing him a massive injustice.\n\nTall, elegant and blessed with astonishing skill, Milan and Brazil utilize Kaka's ability superbly.\n\nMilan coach Carlo Ancelotti soon recognized Kaka's genius, changing his team's system to a 4-4-1-1, playing the Brazilian behind a main target man.\n\nWith Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso holding the central midfield area, Kaka has a license to roam in behind the lone striker, be it Filippo Inzaghi, Ronaldo or Alberto Gilardino.\n\nAnd Kaka does this with devastating effect, running at the opposition with pace and power, finding defense-splitting passes or shooting from range with deadly accuracy be it from a dead-ball situation or open play.\n\nThe fly in the ointment for Milan comes in the shape of their poor form this season.\n\nAlthough they have already reached the last 16 of the Champions League, the club are floundering in Serie A and face the unthinkable prospect of not qualifying for next season's competition unless they win the trophy.\n\nReal Madrid have coveted Kaka for the last two years -- expect the world transfer record to be smashed if Milan don't secure a place among Europe's elite.",

    "text": "(CNN) -- The most compelling action during Michigan's primary Tuesday will be on the Republican side.\n\nThe Democratic Party has stripped the state of its delegates for moving up its primary date so early, and top-tier Democratic candidates have taken their names off the ballot, except for Sen.\n\nThe struggling auto industry has been a drag on Michigan's economy.\n\nIn many ways, the Republican battle for Michigan will be similar to last week's New Hampshire contest.\n\nThe primary is open, and any registered voter -- including independents and Democrats -- can participate.\n\nJohn McCain won New Hampshire with the help of independent voters, and he is campaigning hard to re-create that success in Michigan.\n\nIn that vote, more than half -- 52 percent -- were either independents or Democrats.\n\nAmong Republican voters, McCain lost to Bush 29 percent to 66 percent.\n\nIn that contest, almost three out of every 10 voters identified themselves as members of the religious right.\n\nOverall, Michigan is a swing state, producing narrow margins of victory for presidential candidates and statewide officeholders.\n\nMichigan's governor, Jennifer Granholm, is a Democrat, as are the state's two U.S. senators -- Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow.\n\nThe Democratic presidential nominee has carried Michigan in the last four elections.\n\nJohn Kerry, the Democrats' 2004 standard bearer, won Michigan 51 percent to 48 percent over President Bush.\n\nThe state's economy is powered by the automotive industry, which has experienced its fair share of struggles.\n\nMichigan's unemployment rate, 7.4 percent, is higher than the national average of 5 percent.\n\nWayne County, in the southeastern corner of the state, contains the economically depressed Detroit, Michigan's largest city.\n\nNorth of Wayne County are the more-affluent suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb, which have grown in population in the last two decades.\n\nThese two counties have been the state's central political battleground in recent elections.\n\nWest of Wayne is the \"university belt,\" home to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Michigan State University in East Lansing.\n\nThe area also includes the industrial cities of Saginaw and Flint, where unions remain strong, as well as Jackson and Bay City.\n\nThe state's capital, Lansing, and the sparsely populated upper peninsula are also part of this region.\n\nThe southwest part of the state is dominated by Grand Rapids, Michigan's second-largest city.\n\nGrand Rapids is traditionally Dutch-American and has many Christian conservatives and generally votes Republican.\n\nThe area also contains smaller industrial cities and farming communities.\n\nThe economy of the sparsely populated north and northwest is based on agriculture, tourism and timber.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press has endorsed McCain. \"While the Free Press differs with McCain on a number of issues, the Arizona senator is a smarter, more tested and pragmatic leader who has shown since 2000 that he knows how to build bipartisan alliances around issues,\" the newspaper said in an editorial.\n\nThe Detroit News also endorsed McCain, citing his fiscal conservatism and command of military and foreign affairs, over Michigan native Mitt Romney. \"Other GOP contenders, most notably former Massachusetts Gov.\n\nMitt Romney, are capable figures with impressive resumes and a solid grasp of the issues.\n\nBut McCain's longtime presidential ambitions are at last aligned with the needs of the nation,\" the newspaper said.",

    "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The head of Iraq's main humanitarian group said an 18-year-old approached him with a baby suffering from leukemia.\n\nThe desperate mother said she'd do \"anything\" for treatment for her child -- and then offered herself up for sex.\n\nBaha, 12, waits for treatment in an Iraqi Red Crescent center after shrapnel pierced his left eye.\n\nSaid Ismail Hakki breaks down in tears as he recalls that story.\n\nLeukemia can be treatable to a degree in much of the world, but not in Iraq.\n\nThe baby died two months later. \"It shook me like hell,\" said Hakki, the president of the Iraqi Red Crescent. \"All my life I've been a surgeon.\n\nBut when I see the suffering of those people, that really shook me.\" The plight of Iraq's children is nearing epidemic proportions, he said, with mothers and fathers abandoning their children \"because they're becoming a liability.\" The parents don't do it out of convenience, they do it out of desperation.\n\nWatch the plight of Iraq's children » . \"When you become so desperate, you tend to just throw everything up and go,\" Hakki said. \"Every time I look at those children, I ask myself first, 'What crime have those children committed?'\" Hakki says Red Crescent has the monumental task of treating and feeding more than 1.6 million children under the age of 12 who have become homeless in their own country.\n\nThat's roughly 70 percent of the estimated 2.3 million Iraqis who are homeless inside Iraq.\n\nWith 95,000 volunteers and 5,000 employees, the Iraqi Red Crescent is the last line of defense for the country's poor, sick and displaced.\n\nThey try to blend in as best they can, with Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds working in the neighborhoods distinct to their ethnicities.\n\nSix employees of the Iraqi Red Crescent have been killed over the last four years.\n\nEight have been wounded, including six left disabled by the severity of their wounds.\n\nHakki says the spike in numbers of abandoned children is especially alarming, the result of sectarian violence and drastic socio-economic problems.\n\nThe majority of parents in Iraq, he says, leave their children with a single relative who often has about 20 to 30 children to look after.\n\nMany of the families are living in areas without basic needs, like water and electricity, and there are no jobs available. \"It's a desperate situation,\" he said. \"Children are becoming a liability for both the father and the mother.\" The greatest concern is the ripple effect it will have in the long term -- an entire generation lacking basic life skills, surviving with no education, no income and no families.\n\nSee wounded Iraqi children get help in neighboring Jordan » . \"The trauma of what's happening to those children is enormous,\" he said. \"If somebody is injured by a bullet or shrapnel, it takes a week or two and he's fine. ...\n\nThe psycho-social injury is pretty deep and can take months, if not years, to heal. \"That's the task -- the mammoth task -- the Iraq Red Crescent is facing.\" The group gets some financial support from the central government.\n\nEmbassy, he said, to see if it can offer financial aid.\n\nJust recently, the group closed 18 camps for the winter and is trying to house those thousands of people in abandoned government buildings.\n\nAt a waiting room at an Iraqi Red Crescent treatment center in Baghdad's Mansour district, CNN came across several young children in desperate need of care.\n\nBut they were among the lucky ones -- if that term can even be applied -- because their parents remain with them.\n\nBaha, a 12-year-old boy, was waiting to see a doctor, recalling the exact date -- January 16, 2004 -- he lost his left eye. \"I want my eye to get well,\" he said.\n\nBaha was with his father in a market when someone opened fire on U.S. soldiers.\n\nWhen the soldiers fired back, shrapnel hit his eye.\n\nDespite what happened, this brave boy still goes to that same market. \"I'm not afraid,\" he said.\n\nAcross the room, 3-year-old Saja lightened the mood in the room. \"Iraqis, we are still brothers!\" she sang.\n\nShe giggled, laughed and darted around, bringing smiles to all who saw her.\n\nYet, she couldn't see most of what was around her.\n\nShe's blind in one eye and losing sight in the other -- the result of shoddy medical care.\n\nHer father, Dia'a, said he heard about the Iraqi Red Crescent from television and others who had been treated here.\n\nHe said he can't afford to travel outside the country for medical treatment for his girl.\n\nThis clinic, he said, has given him \"a ray of hope that I had lost.\" He, too, expressed despair over the plight of Iraq's youngest generation. \"Our children are suffering.\n\nAll they talk about is weapons and bombs,\" he said. \"They are children.\n\nWhat happens to them hearing all the explosions and bombs? \"We can't make them feel better because we are down.\" That's a sentiment that haunts the head of the Iraqi Red Crescent. \"There are times I get up in the middle of the night and I say, 'Oh my God, how are we going to solve it?\n\nGod help me to help those kids!'\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nCNN.com's Wayne Drash contributed to this report in Atlanta.",

    "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Coalition forces found 26 bodies buried in mass graves and a bloodstained \"torture complex,\" with chains hanging from walls and ceilings and a bed connected to an electrical system, the military said Wednesday.\n\nTwenty-six bodies were found in mass graves near a \"torture complex\" discovered by coalition forces.\n\nThe troops made the discovery while conducting an operation north of Muqdadiya, Iraq.\n\nFrom December 8 to 11, the troops who found the complex also killed 24 people they said were terrorists and detained 37 suspects, according to a statement issued by Multinational Division North at Camp Speicher in Tikrit.\n\nThe moves were part of an operation called Iron Reaper that has been in progress across northern Iraq for the past few weeks.\n\nThe complex was in an area thought to be an al Qaeda in Iraq haven and operating base, the military said.\n\nIraqis had told the military about the site during an earlier operation. \"Evidence of murder, torture and intimidation against local villagers was found throughout the area,\" the military statement said.\n\nGround forces first found what appeared to be a detention facility, which was one of three connected to the torture complex, Multinational Division North said.\n\nOne of the facilities appeared to have been a headquarters building and a torture facility, it added.\n\nAs the area was cleared, the bodies were found.\n\nEventually, 26 bodies were uncovered in mass graves next to what were thought to be execution sites, the military said.\n\nThe bodies are believed to have been dead between six and eight months, according to a gruesome military video shot at the scene.\n\nSome had their hands tied behind their backs.\n\nIdentification is proving to be a challenge because of advanced decomposition.\n\nPhotos given to the news media show a filthy bed wired to an electrical system, with an outlet hanging from wires on the wall.\n\nIn the video, troops point out rubber hoses and boxing gloves, a ski mask and a blood-covered sword and knives.\n\nOther still photos show an entrance to the underground bunker and barbed wire stretched outside it.\n\nA short distance away from the complex, troops found a bullet-riddled Iraqi police vehicle.\n\nSome of the bodies may belong to Iraqi police, according to the military video.\n\nThe operation netted nine weapons caches, which have been destroyed, the military said.\n\nThey included anti-aircraft weapons, sniper rifles, more than 65 machine guns and pistols, 50 grenades and a surface-to-air missile launcher and platform, the statement said.\n\nAlso found were mines, pipe bombs, rocket-propelled grenades, mortar tubes and rounds and 130 pounds of homemade explosives.",
